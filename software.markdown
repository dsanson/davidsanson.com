Writing
-------

I write most everything---webpages, research articles, notes---in
[MacVim][], using [Pandoc][]'s [extended][] flavor of [markdown][]. I
strongly recommend over Word or LaTeX. In the words of [Michael
Thompson][]:

> The paucity of means is the greatest virtue of markdown and pandoc
> markdown.
>
> It is strangely difficult to get people to see the point, but the
> defects of LaTeX for concentration, writing and thought, are at least
> as great as those of Word, for the simple reason that it gives the
> writer too much power; there is always another package to call in the
> preamble, as there is always another drop down menu in Word. In either
> LaTeX and Word the writer is at each instant faced with the
> possibility of, say, breaking out into 30 pt Comic Sans (...hmm, Comic
> Sans, might need XeTeX here...). LaTeX has the further defect that the
> thought-destroying "fine control" it gives you is so much more
> interesting than what's in a drop-down menu.

> In markdown - not to put too fine a point on it - the writer is only

> sentence should be.

If you use both Vim and pandoc, you might be interested in the
[vim-pandoc][] plugin, which I co-wrote and co-maintain.

Version Control
---------------

Academics should learn to use version control. If you write in a plain
text format, like markdown or LaTeX, you can use [git][]. For more on
using git in the context of writing philosophy papers, see [Mark
Kalderon's Blog][] and [the PhilTeX blog][].

Bibliographic Data
------------------

The best tool for downloading bibliographic data is [Zotero][]. The best
tool for organizing and maintaining bibliographic data and associated
content (PDFs, ePubs, etc.), is [BibDesk][]. [Zot2Bib][] gets Zotero to
feed the data it downloads directly into BibDesk. Unfortunately, it does
not send associated PDFs along as well.

Reading
-------

I use still use [Skim][] to read PDFs, but Apple's Preview.app is
catching up. (This is the one thing that keeps me from adopting Linux:
no adequate PDF viewer with support for annotations.)

When will we have adequate support for academic ePubs?

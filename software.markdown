[Pandoc][]
----------

Pandoc is a command line tool that converts documents from one markup
format to another. In particular, it converts its own [extended][]
[markdown][] into HTML, LaTeX, PDF, ePub, Microsoft Word's DOCX, and
OpenOffice's ODT. Pandoc's extended markdown includes just about
everything you need to write and structure a philosophy paper:
footnotes, labeled propositions (i.e., "definition lists"), citations,
diagrams, support for LaTeX maths... With few exceptions, anything you
can't do in pandoc's markdown is probably something you shouldn't be
doing anyway.

Text Editor
-----------

-   [MacVim][]

If you use both Vim and pandoc, you might be interested in

-   [vim-pandoc][]

Version Control
---------------

As things progress, it is helpful to keep track of revisions. For this,
I use

-   [git][]

Git is version control software. If you write in plain-text, you should
use this. For more on using git in the context of writing philosophy
papers, see [Mark Kalderon's Blog][] and [the PhilTeX blog][].

Research
--------

The best tool for downloading bibliographic data is

-   [Zotero][]

I am hoping that [Zotero Standalone][] is the first step toward a clean
and simple OS X client. For now, I use

-   [Zot2Bib][]

which bypasses Zotero's client, and sends the scraped data directly to

-   [BibDesk][]

Unfortunately, it does not send the PDF along as well.

PDFs
----

For reading and annotating PDFs, I use

-   [Skim][]

Apple's Preview.app keeps getting better at annotations. I'm not sure
how much better Skim is at this point, but Skim is what I am used to.

(This is the one thing that keeps me from seriously considering Linux:
no adequate PDF viewer with support for annotations.)

Other things
------------

-   [Quicksilver][] (an OSX application launcher and much much more)
-   [SimpleNote][] (simple text notes made simple on iOS; syncs with
    Notational Velocity)
-   [Evernote][] (less simple notes and not quite as simple, syncs with
    everything)
-   [Dropbox][] (sharing files between computers made simple)
-   [Pentadactyl][] (a vim-like interface for Firefox)

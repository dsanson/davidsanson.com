What Am I?
==================

This course is structured around that question. 
We will approach it through several clusters of inter-related
questions:

-   Am I a soul, or a spirit? Am I a human animal? Am I a mind? A brain? A story I
tell to myself? 

-   Do I know myself? How? What about others? Do I know that they are also
"selves" like me?

-   I am consciously aware of many things. But what is consciousness, and how am I
related to my consciousness?

-   Am I a free agent—something that deliberates and makes choices and makes a
difference in the world? Am I responsible for what I do? Or am I a machine,
laboring under the illusion that I am free, when in fact nothing I do is under
my control?

-   What makes me *me*? What is my *essence*? To what extent is it up to me what I
am or what is essential to me? Am I essentially a man or a woman? Am I
essentially Black, or White, or Asian, or Latino?

We will approach these questions through philosophy. Philosophy aims to use
reason to tackle hard problems like these. We won't always succeed at
discovering the truth, but we can get a better sense of which answers make
sense and which do not, and which are more likely to be true.

Course Objectives
=================

The first and most fundamental objective of this course is to teach you what
it is like to think through philosophical problems like a philosopher. 

One of the fundamental tools in philosophy is argument identification and
analysis. The course assignments will be focused on improving this fundamental
skill. This skill that has broad application outside of philosophy: it is, in
essence, the ability to *think* in a clear and explicit way, and communicate
your thoughts to others in a clear and explicit way.

Those objectives are topic-neutral: they would apply to any course on any
philosophical topic. But the topic of this course—the self—has been one of the
central topics in philosophy since its beginning, and continues to be a
central topic in philosophy today. It is a topic that touches upon central
issues in [metaphysics, epistemology, the philosophy of mind, political
philosophy, and
ethics](/handouts/brief-overview-of-areas-of-philosophy.html). 

So this course will expose you to a range of important positions and arguments
across several areas of philosophical research. If you are a non-major, it
will make for a good topical overview of many parts of the discipline. If
you are a major, it will help you see connections. 

But really, why bother worrying about philosophical questions at all? That's a
hard question. Hopefully this course will put you in a better position to
answer it for yourself. But I kind of like this answer, from Bertrand
Russell: 

> The value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very
> uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life
> imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual
> beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up
> in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To
> such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common
> objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously
> rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find
> [...] that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very
> incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with
> certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to
> suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the
> tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to
> what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be;
> it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled
> into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder
> by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect. (Bertrand Russell, "[The
Value of
Philosophy](/texts/russell-value-of-philosophy.html)", from his *The
> Problems of Philosophy* (1912), p. 156-157)

So I suppose one of the objectives of this course is to "free [you] from the
tyranny of custom" and remove your "somewhat arrogant dogmatism," but that
seems a bit too personal to state as a course objective. 

This course is in the Humanities category of the General Education program.
Such courses are supposed to achieve some subset of a long list of objectives
decided upon by committee. I've listed all the objectives at the end of the
syllabus. The University hopes that, by reading these objectives, you will get
a sense of how the General Education program is meant to work as a whole, and
how this course contributes to that whole. 

It seems to me that this course should help you think about what contributes
to the quality of life (Ib). And it should help you make informed judgments
(IIa) and report those judgments, in a clear and analytic way (IIb), while
demonstrating the ability to think reflectively (IIId), in order to identify
and solve problems (IVa).

Books
=====

I have ordered two texts for the course:

-   Shaun Gallagher, Ed. (2011). *The Oxford Handbook of the Self*. Oxford:
    Oxford University Press. ISBN-13: 978-0199679546
-   Robert Kane (2005).  *A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will*. Oxford:
    Oxford University Press. ISBN-13: 978-0195149708

I have put Kane's book on course reserve at Milner. Unfortunately, Milner does not own *The Oxford Handbook of the Self*.

Additional readings are available from the [schedule](schedule.html). Note
that many of links are only accessible to those enrolled in the class. 

You are also encouraged to search for
books and articles on topics that catch your interest. A good place to start
is <http://philpapers.org>

Assignments
===========

Your grade will be based upon

-   homework exercises (10%),
-   "levels papers" (40%),
-   a midterm (25%) and final (25%) 

Homework exercises will be assigned occasionally throughout the term as
appropriate and graded pass/fail. "Levels papers" are explained in detail
below. Exams will be in class, and will consist of a mix of short answer and essay
questions related to the readings and class discussions.

**Attendance is required**, but I am not going to make a habit of "taking"
attendance. Instead, I will make a habit of cold-calling at random. If I
cold-call you at random and you are not present, I will take note. Each time
this happens, your grade for the course will drop by 1%. 

Levels Papers[^lev]
-------------

[^lev]: I borrow this system (and much of the following description) from [Dustin Locke](http://www.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/dlocke/docs/Locke_LevelsSystem.pdf).

The "levels papers" are modeled after video game mechanics. There are
three levels for you to progress through, and you are allowed to
progress to the next level only after you have completed the previous
level. Just as with levels in video games, the idea here is to insure
that you are always working on a task that is challenging enough to be
interesting, but not so challenging that it is frustrating.

Your “levels grade” is determined by how far you progress through the
levels. You have a maximum of five attempts at the levels, each due on a
specific day (see schedule). After attempting a level, you will receive
one of four evaluations: “not much progress”, “making progress”, “almost”,
or “complete”. Each attempt must be written on one of the readings
covered since the last attempt was due (hence, each attempt will be on a
new topic---you will not be rewriting the previous attempt). Your levels
grade will be determined by how far through the levels you progress, and
which evaluation you get on the last level you attempt, according to
the following scale:

                 Not much progress   Making progress   Almost   Complete
  ------------- ------------------- ----------------- -------- ----------
  **Level 3**            B                 B+            A-        A
  **Level 2**           C-                  C            C+        B-
  **Level 1**            F                 D-            D         D+


Brief descriptions of each level are as follows:

**Level 1**. Expository paper, between 150 and 300 words. Choose one
particula*r argument from the readings and explain that argument in a
very short paper. We will be doing some exercises during the first
couple of weeks of class that will prepare you to write this paper.

**Level 2**. Expository paper, between 400 and 600 words. This paper
will be just like level 1, except that you will explain two arguments
from the reading that have some important relationship to one another.
For example, you might choose to discuss an argument and then another
argument that is an objection to the first . Alternatively, you might
choose a second argument that builds on the first argument. There are
other possibilities as well — the only requirement is that the two came
from the readings and have some interesting relationship to one another.
(When you write your paper, you should make it clear just what the
relationship is.) As this paper now has a bit of complexity, make sure
to include an introductory paragraph that briefly explains what your
paper is going to be about and how it will proceed.

**Level 3**. Expository and critical paper, between 700 and 1000 words.
This will be just like level 2, except that you will also argue that one
of the arguments you discuss is unsound (i.e., that it either has a
false premise or a bad inference). Your criticism here must be original,
and you should be sure to defend your criticism against potential
objections.

You have a maximum of five attempts at the levels. The due dates for these
attempts can be found on the course calendar.


Getting in Touch
================

Email is the best way to reach me when I am not in my office. I am not
always online and I cannot always respond immediately. If I have not
responded in 24 hours please email me again, letting me know it is your
second email (I won't take this as harassment). Include "251" in the
subject line of your email and your full name somewhere in the body of
your email, so I know who you are(!), and that the email is related to
this class.

Disabilities
============

Any student needing to arrange a reasonable accommodation for a
documented disability should contact Disability Concerns at 350 Fell
Hall, 309‐438‐5853, <http://www.disabilityconcerns.ilstu.edu>.

Other Sources of Support
========================

Life at college can get very complicated. Students sometimes feel
overwhelmed, lost, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with
relationship difficulties or diminished self-esteem. Many of these
issues can be effectively addressed with a little help. Student
Counseling Services (SCS) helps students cope with difficult emotions
and life stressors. Student Counseling Services is staffed by
experienced, professional psychologists and counselors, who are attuned
to the needs of college students. The services are free and completely
confidential. Find out more at <http://counseling.illinoisstate.edu> or
by calling 309-438-3655.

Academic Misconduct
===================

Academic integrity is expected and required. Students are expected to be
honest in all academic work. A student's placement of his or her name on
any academic exercise shall be regarded as assurance that the work is
the result of the student’s own thought, effort, and study.

If you have questions, refer to the Code of Student Conduct, B1
(Academic Integrity), which outlines unacceptable behaviors in academic
matters, or talk to me. In certain circumstances (such as cheating or
plagiarism) I may be required to refer a student to Community Rights &
Responsibilities for a violation of Illinois State University's Code of
Student Conduct.

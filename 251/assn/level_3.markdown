# Level Three Assignment Instructions

**You cannot attempt a level three assignment until you have received a "Complete"
on a level three assignment.**

You paper should be between 700 and 1000 words. It should be double-spaced, in
a reasonable font, with at least 1 inch margins on all sides.

This paper is just like a level 2 paper, except that you will also argue that one of the arguments you discuss is unsound (i.e., that it either has a false premise or a bad inference). Your criticism here must be original, and you should be sure to defend your criticism against potential objections.

If you wish to argue that one of the arguments has a false premise, please be
sure to explicitly identify the premise that you take to be false, and explain
why you take it to be false. For example,

> I think that premise (3) is false. Premise (3) says that, if I can imagine
*a* existing without *b* and *b* existing without *a*, then *a* and *b* are
distinct. But Lois Lane can imagine Superman existing without Clark Kent and
Clark Kent existing without Superman, even though Clark Kent and Superman are
the same person.

And be sure to consider potential objections. For example,

> Someone might object, and say that Lois cannot imagine Superman existing
without Clark Kent existing. Instead, she imagines Superman never getting out
of his superhero costume. In such a situation, Superman exists, and so does
Clark Kent, since they are the same person. It is just that that person never
gets out of his costume. But if you say this, then... [add some explanation of
where you think this takes the argument]

Again, this paper will be more complex than a level one or level two paper. So
be sure to include a brief introductory paragraph explaining what you will do in
the paper and how you will proceed. And you might want to include a brief
concluding paragraph, explaining what you take yourself to have shown.

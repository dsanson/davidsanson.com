# Level One Assignment Instructions

You paper should be between 150 and 300 words. It should be double-spaced, in
a reasonable font, with at least 1 inch margins on all sides.

Choose one specific argument from the readings. This is not an exercise in
making up your own argument. It is an exercise in getting clear about someone
else's argument. Be sure it is an *argument*: an attempt to marshal reasons in
support of a conclusion. Be sure to include a reference to the work and page
number that contains the argument.

Your paper should have two parts:

Part I
------

Present the argument in premise-conclusion form. That is, a list of numbered
declarative sentences, followed by a conclusion. Here is an example of what I
mean:

1.  The mind thinks.
2.  Hamburger does not think.
3.  The brain is just glorified hamburger.
4.  Therefore, the mind is not the brain.

(This argument has three premises, but your argument might have some other
number of premises.)

Note that each premise should be a single sentence that can be evaluated as
true or false. Premises should not be paragraphs. They should not be
incomplete sentence bullet points. They should not be questions.

Try to reconstruct an argument that is *valid*. If you find an argument in the
reading that doesn't seem to be valid, try to identify appropriate
*implicit* premises: assumptions that the author might be making that would
make the argument valid.

Part II
-------

In a short paragraph, explain to your reader how the conclusion is supposed to
follow from the premises. Be sure, in do this, to make reference to the
premises of the argument. Here is an example of what I mean:

> According to premise (1) the mind thinks, but according to (2), hamburger
does not think. But (3) says that the brain is just glorified hamburger. So
this suggests that the brain, like hamburger, doesn't think. So it follows
that the mind is not the brain, because the mind thinks, but the brain
doesn't.

Your first attempt is due in class, Monday, August 31st.

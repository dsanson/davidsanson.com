# Final Study Guide --- Philosophy 251 

The final is on Tuesday, 12/8, from 1:00 -- 3:00 pm, in our usual classroom.
It will be closed book and closed notes. You will need to bring a new bluebook to class. 

The final is cumulative. All questions for the final will be taken from the
questions below **OR** from the midterm study guide. But the selection of
questions will be weighted toward the questions below. As before, questions
(@1) and (@2) are certain to be on the exam.

@1.  An argument is **valid** just in case \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

@2.  An argument is **sound** just in case \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

@.  Explain Dennett's view (as described by Schectman (p. 397ff)) that the
    self is a fictional 'center of narrative gravity'.

@.  Explain the following quote from Wittgenstein:

    > "There is no question of recognizing a person when I say I have
    > a tooth-ache. To ask, "are you sure it is *you* who have pains?" would
    > be nonsensical."

@.  Give a counterexample to the claim that an utterance of 'I' refers to the
    thing that produced it. Give a counterexample to the claim that an
    utterance of 'I' refers to the human being who produced it. Explain how
    Nozick's proposal that,

    > An utterance of 'I' refers to that being with the capacity of referring
    > to itself who produces that very token T,

    avoids these two counterexamples.

@.  What is the difference between "surface freedom" and "deep freedom"? Give
    an example in which someone has the first but does not have the second.

@.  Explain the distinction between compatiblism and incompatibilism.

@.  Give an account of freedom that is compatible with determinism. Explain
    how it is compatible with determinism, and why it counts as a kind
    of freedom.

@.  Present the "Consequence Argument" for incompatibilism? Present and assess
    one objection to the argument.

@. What is the distinction between first-order and second-order desires? What
    is an example of a first-order desire? What is an example of a
    second-order desire?

@. What are Frankfurt's definitions of 'will' and 'volition'? Give the
    definitions and illustrate with examples.

@. What are Frankfurt's definitions of 'Wanton' and 'Person'? Give the
    defintions and illustrate with examples.

@.  According to Frankfurt, what is freedom of the will? Why is the unwilling
    addict not free? Why is the wanton not free? Why is the person with
    unresolved conflicting volitions not free?

@.  What problem does higher-order conflict pose for Frankfurt's account of
    Freedom of Will? How does he attempt to deal with this problem? What is
    Watson's objection to his solution?

@.  Explain Watson's distinction between value and desire, illustrating
    with examples. Can you value something that you do not desire? If so, what
    would be an example? If not, why not? Can you desire something that you do
    not value? If so, what would be an example? If not, why not?

@.  According to Watson, what is a free agent? Is the unwilling addict a free
    agent? Could someone who has no values at all be a free agent?

@.  Both Watson and Frankfurt attempt to provide accounts of freedom that make
    a distinction between desires that are "really yours" and desires that you
    have but do not endorse. Compare and contrast their accounts of
    this distinction.

@. Explain the distinction between natural kinds and social kinds,
    illustrating with examples. Also explain the distinction between natural
    entities and social entities, and give examples. What is the difference
    between these two distinctions?

@. Give one argument against biological realism about race.

@. Explain the difference between biological realism, social constructivism,
    and eliminativism about race.

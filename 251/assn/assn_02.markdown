# Instructions

This is an assignment to be completed *on paper*, and turned in in class. All problems are worth 10 points each, and will be added to the points you have earned on the quizzes and the Logic 2010 homework assignments.

# Symbolization

@.  'unless' is another way of saying \_\_\_\_\_\_?
@.  'but' is another way of saying \_\_\_\_\_\_\_?
@.  'provided that' is another way of saying \_\_\_\_\_\_?
@.  'if' always introduces the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?
@.  'only if' always introduces the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?
@.  How do you symbolize 'Neither P nor Q'?


# Tautologies and Tautological Validity

Complete the following definitions:

@.  A sentence is a tautology just in case \_\_\_\_\_\_?
@.  An argument is tautologically valid just in case \_\_\_\_\_\_?
@.  Briefly explain the difference between a sentence and argument, and
    the difference between truth and validity.


# Arguments

For each of the following arguments, complete the following tasks:

a.  Think through the argument without the help of our tools, and decide
    whether or not you think it is valid. Write down your answer (it is
    okay if this turns out to be wrong).
b.  Symbolize the argument (10 pts).
c.  Construct a truth table to decide whether or not it is
    tautologically valid (10 pts).
d.  If it is tautologically valid, construct a derivation (10 pts).

@.  We can't both conduct a war and solve our domestic problems.
    Therefore, we can solve our domestic problems only if we don't
    conduct a war.

@.  God does loves all humans unless he loves only one, and if he loves
    only one, then he does not love all. Therefore, god does not love
    all humans.

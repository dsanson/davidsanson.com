@.  An argument is **valid** just in case \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

@.  An argument is **sound** just in case \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

@.  What is Augustine trying to show when he says,

    > For a man who does not exist can surely not be
    > mistaken either, and if I am mistaken, therefore I exist.

@.  Descartes argues that there is one thing about which he cannot be
    deceived. What is that thing, and why does he think he cannot be deceived
    about it?

@.  Explain Hume's point in the following passage, and why it is an objection
    to Descartes:

    > For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. 

@.  Give a non-question-begging characterization of what it is to have a mind.

@.  Give a non-question-begging characterization of what it is to have a body.


@.  What is substance dualism? According to the substance dualist, what is a
mind?

@.  What does Ryle mean when he says that the substance dualism rests upon a
"category mistake"? Present and explain one of his examples of a category
mistake (the university example, the division example, or the team spirit
example), and explain how it relates to the mind-body problem.

@.  What is Logical Behaviorism? 

@.  What is Interactionist Dualism? Present one objection to Interactionist
Dualism.

@.  What is Epiphenomenalism? Present one objection to Epiphenomenalism.

@.  According to Smart,  the Behaviorist holds that,

    > "...when I "report" a pain, I am not really reporting anything [...] but am
doing a sophisticated sort of wince..."

    Is this a fair description of the Behaviorist position?

@.  What is the identity theory of mental states?

@.  What does it mean to say that mental states are multiply realizable?
Explain how functionalism allows for this, and why identity theory does not.

@.  What is the "Hard Problem of Consciousness"?

@.  Nagel uses the example of "what it is like to be a bat" to argue against
    physicalism. What does he mean by physicalism, and what is his argument?

@.  According to the "Knowledge Argument", the case of Mary, the
    neuroscientist who has seen no color, not all facts are physical facts.
    How does that argument go?

@.  What is the problem of knowing other minds? 

@.  What is the "Turing Test"? What is it meant to show? Present and assess
one objection to the claim that the test shows what it is meant to show.

@.  What is Searle's "Chinese Room" example? What is it meant to show?

@.  What is the functionalist theory of mental states?

@.  What is the soul theory of personal identity? Present a thought experiment
that causes trouble for soul theory.

@.  What is the spatiotemporal continuity theory of personal identity? Present
a thought experiment that causes trouble for this theory.

@.  Present Locke's example of the Prince and the Cobbler. What does Locke
take this example to show? Do you agree? If so, why? If not, why not?

@.  What is the psychological continuity theory of personal identity? Present
a thought experiment that causes trouble for this theory.


@.  Suppose God decided to "reuse" Napoleon's soul when he created you, but he
first removed all memories, beliefs, and character traits. Are you Napoleon?
What answer does the soul theorist give in this case? The spatiotemporal
continuity theory? The psychological continuity theory? What do you think the
right answer is?

@.  You go to sleep in your bed. In the morning, a person wakes up who looks just
like you, but has all the memories, beliefs, and character traits of Napoleon.
Is that person you? What answer does the soul theorist give in this case? The spatiotemporal
continuity theory? The psychological continuity theory? What do you think the
right answer is?

@.  Why does the possibility of psychological duplication (e.g., in the
twice-over brain transplant case) cause trouble for the psychological
continuity theory?

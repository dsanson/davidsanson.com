# Levels Papers

You will have five opportunities to turn in a levels paper: on 8/31, 9/21,
10/12, 11/2, and 12/2.

As we approach those deadlines, I will provide you, in class, with a clear
description of what each level entails. These instructions are also linked
below. 

Please note that, for each attempt, you can only consider arguments from
the **new readings** that we have done since the previous attempt. You cannot
try to write a paper on the same argument(s) twice.

# Exam Study Guides

Prior to both the midterm and the final I will post a study guide. All
questions on the exams will be taken from the study guides.

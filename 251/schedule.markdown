Read This First!
============

Philosophy is hard to read. You cannot read a piece of philosophy and expect
to passively absorb its content. You need to learn how to fight with the
text: generate objections, questions, puzzles and push those objections onto
the text and see if it pushes back.

You can't do this by just reading piece once all the way through. So break the
process down into steps:

**Step 1: First Read Through**. 
Read the piece all the way through, and try to get a general sense of what the
author is doing. If you get lost, don't stop: just try to push through.

**Step 2: Question**.
Attempt to answer the following questions:

1.  What is the author's thesis? What is she trying to argue for?\
    Do you agree with it? If not, why not? If so, why?

2.  What are her arguments? Where are they in the text?\
    Do you find her arguments convincing? If not, why not? If so, why?

3.  How does this relate to what you've come across in the other readings?\
    Is she agreeing with something someone else said? Disagreeing? What
        are the points of agreement and disagreement?



Most likely, you won't be able to answer all these questions, or your answers
will be a bit vague and uncertain.

**Step 3: Reread**.
Read the piece again. This time, read it with
all those questions, and your answers,
in mind. If you weren't sure what her thesis was, keep an eye out for clues.
And keep an eye out for the passages that contain the arguments. If you found
yourself disagreeing with the author, or found her arguments unconvincing,
look for passages that address your objections or concerns: push your worries
on the text and see if it pushes back.

**Repeat**.
Keeping trying to answer the questions. Keep rereading. A good philosophy article will reveal
more to you every time you read it. As you get familiar with its structure and
content, you will be able to focus in on the more important parts. Try to
reconstruct the key arguments in premise-conclusion form. Try to come up with
counterexamples to key premises or assumptions that the author is making. Look
for arguments in this paper that interact with arguments from other papers
you've read, and try to make sense of how the arguments are related.

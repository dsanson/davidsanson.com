How This Site is Built
======================

This site is generated by [Hakyll], which in turn depends on [Haskell] and [Pandoc]. CSS files are generated by [Sass], which depends on [Ruby]. The PDF copy of my CV is generated by Pandoc and [LaTeX], using a Makefile.

So, to generate a working version of this site from this source, assuming you have all of that installed, you first need to compile 'site.hs':

~~~{.bash}
$ ghc site.hs
~~~

Then build the site,

~~~{.bash}
$ ./site build
~~~

title: DRAFT Philosophy 363 — Readings and Assignments 
instructor: David Sanson
...

**DRAFT! INCOMPLETE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE**

This is a schedule of topics, readings and assignments for Philosophy 363,
Spring 2015.

Readings should be completed *before* class, and then again *after* class.
Reading philosophy is not like reading a novel: you cannot read an article in
philosophy and get the "gist" of it and move on. You need to read an article
first to get the "gist" of it, and then reread it again and again until you
actually understand what the author is saying.

We meet once a week for three hours. You will typically be expected to read
three related articles a week, and come to class prepared to discuss all
three.

I have divided the readings into three categories: "required," "recommended,"
and "more." The required readings are required. I also expect you to make a
regular habit of exploring some of the "recommended" readings: a good habit
would be to pick one to read each week.

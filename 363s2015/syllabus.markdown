# Course Description

The title of this course is "Topics in Metaphysics and Epistemology." Each
time I teach it, I choose a different topic to focus on. This term, our focus
will be on the metaphysics of properties.

Things have *properties*. A candle, for example, has a certain shape, mass,
and smell. Another candle might have the same shape, a different mass, and the 
same smell. Philosophers call things like shapes, masses, and smells 
properties.

What are properties? Some philosophers---the so-called realists---think that, 
when two candles have the same shape, there is a single entity that they both 
have, and call this a *universal*. Some realists, following Plato, think of 
universals as abstract entities that exist outside of space and time. Others, 
following Aristotle, think of universals as multiply located entities thatare 
wholly present in each of their instances. Other philosophers---the so-called 
nominalists---attempt to provide an account of what it means to say that two 
candles have "the same shape" that doesn't involve any appeal to universals. 
So one of the things we will do is spend some time looking at the debate 
between realists and nominalists, sorting out the various arguments and 
objections on each side.

What properties are there? On one conception of properties---the *abundant* 
conception---for any collection of objects, there is a corresponding property. 
On another conception---the *sparse* conception---the only collections that 
correspond to properties are collections that "cut nature at the joints." But 
what does it mean to "cut nature at the joints"? And what properties do this? 
One common view is that science reveals the joints of nature, so the natural 
properties are the properties that figure in our best scientific theories. So 
we will spend some time looking at proposals for how to mark this distinction, 
and thinking about what they tell us about what properties there are.

Finally, we will look at recent work on the metaphysics of race and gender. 
*being black* and *being a woman* appear to be properties. But they don't seem 
to "cut nature at the joints". So perhaps they are among the abundant 
properties, but not the sparse properties. But if we say that, we run the risk 
of being unable to explain the role that race and gender play in shaping 
society and our lives. So we will spend some time thinking about what race and 
gender are, and thinking about how that might influence what we want to say 
about properties more generally.

Books
=====

I have ordered three books for this course.

-   Armstrong, David M. 1989. *Universals: An Opinionated Introduction*.
    Boulder, CO: Westview Press.
-   Haslanger, Sally. 2012. *Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social
    Critique*. Oxford University Press.
-   Ney, Alyssa. 2014. *Metaphysics: An Introduction*. Hoboken: Taylor;
    Francis.

Additional readings, in the form of journal articles and excerpts from books,
will be posted as PDF files on ReggieNet. The literature on properties is
huge. You are also encouraged to search for books and articles on topics that
catch your interest. A good place to start is [PhilPapers.org][].

Assignments
===========

Your grade will be based upon

-   homework exercises (10%),
-   "levels papers" (50%),
-   a final paper (40%),
-   attendance (see below).

Homework exercises will be assigned occasionally throughout the term as
appropriate and graded pass/fail. "Levels papers" are explained in detail
below. The final paper will be a longer paper on a topic of your choice,
determined in consultation with me.

Levels Papers[^1] {#levels-paperslev}
-----------------

The "levels papers" are modeled after video game mechanics. There are three
levels for you to progress through, and you are allowed to progress to the
next level only after you have completed the previous level. Just as with
levels in video games, the idea here is to insure that you are always working
on a task that is challenging enough to be interesting, but not so challenging
that it is frustrating. Each of the levels will help prepare you to write the
final paper for the course (writing the final paper is kind of like the "boss
battle" for this course).

Your “levels grade” is determined by how far you progress through the levels.
You have a maximum of five attempts at the levels, each due on a specific day
(see schedule). After attempting a level, you will receive one of four
evaluations: “not much progress”, “good effort”, “almost”, or “complete”. Each
attempt must be written on one of the readings covered since the last attempt
was due (hence, each attempt will be on a new topic---you will not be
rewriting the previous attempt). Your levels grade will be determined by how
far through the levels you progress, and which evaluation you get on the last
level you attempt, according to the following scale:

Level 3
:   Complete = A, Almost = A-, Good Effort = B+, Not much progress = B

Level 2
:   Complete = B-, Almost = C+, Good Effort = C, Not much progress = C-

Level 1
:   Complete = D, Almost = D-, Good Effort = F, Not much progress = F

The complete instructions for each level are as follows:

**Level 1**. Expository paper, between 150 and 300 words. Choose one
particular argument from the readings and explain that argument in a very
short paper. We will be doing some exercises during the first couple of weeks
of class that will prepare you to write this paper.

**Level 2**. Expository paper, between 400 and 600 words. This paper will be
just like level 1, except that you will explain two arguments from the reading 
that have some important relationship to one another. For example, you
might choose to discuss an argument and then another argument that is an
objection to the first. Alternatively, you might choose a second argument
that builds on the first argument. There are other possibilities as well — the
only requirement is that the two came from the readings and have some
interesting relationship to one another. (When you write your paper, you
should make it clear just what the relationship is.) As this paper now has a
bit of complexity, make sure to include an introductory paragraph that briefly
explains what your paper is going to be about and how it will proceed.

**Level 3**. Expository and critical paper, between 700 and 1000 words. This
will be just like level 2, except that you will also argue that one of the
arguments you discuss is unsound (i.e., that it either has a false premise or
a bad inference). Your criticism here must be original, and you should be sure
to defend your criticism against potential objections.

You have a maximum of five attempts at the levels. The deadlines for those
five attempts are:

Attempt 1
:   Feb 17th

Attempt 2
:   March 3rd

Attempt 3
:   March 24th

Attempt 4
:   April 11th

Attempt 5
:   May 2nd

Attendance
----------

Attendance is required. You are allowed up to ~~five~~ three unexcused
absences without penalty. After that, each absence will result in the loss of
a full letter grade in the course. So if you have six unexcused absences, the
highest grade you can get in a B; if you have seven, a C; eight, a D; nine, an
F.

==============

I will use ReggieNet to post announcements and additional readings. This
syllabus and the schedule of assignments and readings can be found on my
personal website.

Getting in Touch
================

Email is the best way to reach me when I am not in my office. I am not always
online and I cannot always respond immediately. If I have not responded in 24
hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won't
take this as harassment). Include "363" in the subject line of your email and
your full name somewhere in the body of your email, so I know who you are(!),
and that the email is related to this class.

Disabilities
============

Any student needing to arrange a reasonable accommodation for a documented
disability should contact Disability Concerns at 350 Fell Hall, 309‐438‐5853,
<http://www.disabilityconcerns.ilstu.edu>.

Other Sources of Support
========================

Life at college can get very complicated. Students sometimes feel overwhelmed,
lost, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationship
difficulties or diminished self-esteem. Many of these issues can be
effectively addressed with a little help. Student Counseling Services (SCS)
helps students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. Student
Counseling Services is staffed by experienced, professional psychologists and
counselors, who are attuned to the needs of college students. The services are
free and completely confidential. Find out more at
<http://counseling.illinoisstate.edu> or by calling 309-438-3655.

Academic Misconduct
===================

Academic integrity is expected and required. Students are expected to be
honest in all academic work. A student's placement of his or her name on any
academic exercise shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result
of the student’s own thought, effort, and study.

If you have questions, refer to the Code of Student Conduct, B1 (Academic
Integrity), which outlines unacceptable behaviors in academic matters, or talk
to me. In certain circumstances (such as cheating or plagiarism) I may be
required to refer a student to Community Rights & Responsibilities for a
violation of Illinois State University's Code of Student Conduct.

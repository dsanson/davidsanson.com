How This Site is Built
----------------------

This site is generated by

-   [Hakyll][]

The site is hosted on

-   [NearlyFreeSpeech.net][],

an inexpensive pay-as-you-go bare-bones **reputable** web host. I end up
paying \~\$9 a year for domain registration and \~50Â¢ a month for
storage and bandwidth. I've been happy with them so far. To keep that
price low, large files (like PDFs) are hosted via

-   [Dropbox][]

To make the Dropbox URLs look better, I use

-   [Dropbprox][]

A [mirror of the site][] is available via [Github Pages][]. The
[source][] of the site is available as [Github Repo][].

If I were starting over today, I would host the site via Github Pages. 
The hosting is free, and if you are happy with a url like
<http://dsanson.github.io> that's that. They also support [custom
domains][], though you need to purchase the domain name from someone
else. That is actually a bit of a hassle. The cheapest registrars offer
.com addresses for \~\$10/year (sometimes half that for the first year).
But many registrars (like GoDaddy) are sleazy: watch out for hidden
privacy fees, first-year only discounts, and policies that make it hard
to switch to another registrar. At best, switching to Github Pages would
save me \$5 to \$6 a year.

But I wouldn't have to worry about additional storage and
bandwidth fees.

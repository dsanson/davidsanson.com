What is truth? What are truths? How is truth related to meaning? Is moral
truth the same kind of thing as scientific truth? What is reality? What does
it mean to be a realist or an anti-realist? Can something be true *for me* but
not true *for you*? Can something be real *for me* but not real *for you*? Can truth
outstrip reality? How is truth related to fiction? How is fiction related to
reality? And what to say about sentences like, 'this sentence is not true'?

Students who are not sure whether or not they will be interested in the
content of the course might take a look at the following articles from the
*Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*, to get a sense of what we will be
discussing:

-   [Truth][], [Realism][], [Facts][], [Propositions][], [Liar Paradox][].

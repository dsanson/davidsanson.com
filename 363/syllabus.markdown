# Course Description

The title of this course is "Topics in Metaphysics and Epistemology." Each
time I teach it, I choose a different topic to focus on. This term, our focus
will be on truth and reality.

What is truth? What are truths? How is truth related to meaning? Is moral
truth the same kind of thing as scientific truth? What is reality? What does
it mean to be a realist or an anti-realist? Can something be true *for me* but
not true *for you*? Can something be real *for me* but not real *for you*? Can
truth outstrip reality? How is truth related to fiction? How is fiction
related to reality? And what to say about sentences like, 'this sentence is
not true'?

Readings
========

Readings will be made available online. I will also put some books on reserve
at Milner Library.

Requirements
===========

This is an advanced seminar-style course. It is important that you come to
class, and that you come to class prepared to participate, and it is important
that, over the semester, you gain the skills needed to produce a substantive
term paper.

There will be three main categories of assignment. All assignments are
**required**. They will be weighted as follows:

<ul style="text-align:left; list-style-type:disc">
<li>Term paper (30% total)
<ul style="text-align:left; list-style-type:disc">
<li>Term paper (25%), due Finals Week.</li>
<li>Term paper proposal (2.5%), due Week 14, graded pass/fail</li>
<li>Peer feedback on term paper proposals (2.5%), due Week 15, graded pass/fail</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Weekly preparation and participation (30% total)
<ul style="text-align:left; list-style-type:disc">
<li>Reading response papers (10% total), graded pass/fail</li>
<li>Independent reading assignments (10% total), pass/fail</li>
<li>Discussion participation (10% total), pass/fail</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Levels assignments (40% total)</li>
</ul>

Term Paper
----------

Your term paper will be a 10-15 page paper on a topic of you choose in
consultation with me, related to the topics we cover in this class. 

You will be required to write up a 2 to 3 page proposal/synopsis of
your term paper, and share it with your peers. You will also be required to
provide written and oral feedback on three of your peers' proposals.

Participation
-------------

This will be a small discussion based class. It is essential that everyone
participates. This means that you must come to each class, and you need to
make at least one substantive contribution to class discussion each week.

Reading Response Papers
-----------------------

A Reading Response Paper is a short (250 words or less) informal paper. You
pick one of the assigned readings for the week, and

-   state as clearly as possible what you take to be the central thesis of the
    reading.
-   state as clearly as possible one objection or concern you have about that
    thesis or about how the author defends it.

Reading Response Papers must be turned in to our shared Dropbox folder, and
are due every week, by midnight the day before class. You are all encouraged
to find time before class to quickly read through each other's reading response
papers, in preparation for class discussion.

Independent Reading Assignment
-------------------------------

To complete an independent reading assignment, you must find and read an article that is related to our assigned readings,
either on [philpapers.org](http://philpapers.org) or the Philosophers Index.
You then must post a PDF copy of the paper to our shared Dropbox folder, along
with a short paragraph explaining how it relates to the assigned readings.
These are due at the same time as the reading response papers.

Independent Reading Assignments are due every week **except** those weeks when
you choose to attempt a levels assignment.

Levels Assignments
------------------

Every other week you will have the opportunity to complete a levels
assignment.

"Levels assignments" are modeled after video game mechanics. There are four
levels for you to progress through, and you are allowed to progress to the
next level only after you have completed the previous level. Just as with
levels in video games, the idea here is to insure that you are always working
on a task that is challenging enough to be interesting, but not so challenging
that it is frustrating. Each of the levels will help prepare you to write the
final paper for the course (writing the final paper is kind of like the "boss
battle" for this course).

Your “levels grade” is determined by how far you progress through the levels.
You have a maximum of seven attempts at the levels, each due on a specific day
(see schedule). After attempting a level, you will receive one of three
evaluations: “confused”, “needs work”, or “complete”.

Although you will often attempt an assignment at the same level, you will not
be rewriting or reworking previous attempts: each assignment will be new, and
will be keyed to the reading for that week.

**Level 1**. Basic Toolkit Worksheet. I will provide you with a worksheet with
exercises related to soundness and validity, counterexamples, and
distinguishing arguments from explanations.

**Level 2**. Argument Reconstruction and Evaluation, between 150 and 300 words.
Choose one interesting
valid argument from the readings and (a) reconstruct it in
premise-conclusion form, clearly enough so that it is obvious that it is
valid; (b) state which premise you think is least plausible; (c) if you think that
premise is nevertheless true, say why. If you think it is false, say why.

**Level 3**. Dialectic, between 400 and 600 words. Choose one interesting argument from
the readings and one objection from the readings to that argument and (a)
reconstruct the argument in premise-conclusion form; (b) present the objection
to the argument, being sure to clearly indicate whether it is an objection to
validity or an objection to the truth of one of the premises, and, if so,
which one. Assess the force of the objection: do you agree with it, or do you
think it misses the mark? Why?

**Level 4**. Extended Dialectic, between 700 and 1000 words. Choose two
interestingly related arguments from the readings, that reflect some
significant disagreement. Reconstruct and evaluate both arguments---be sure to
discuss any plausible objections, and assess their force---and discuss
how they are related.


Getting in Touch
================

Email is the best way to reach me when I am not in my office. I am not always
online and I cannot always respond immediately. If I have not responded in 24
hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won't
take this as harassment). Include "363" in the subject line of your email and
your full name somewhere in the body of your email, so I know who you are(!),
and that the email is related to this class.

Disabilities
============

Any student needing to arrange a reasonable accommodation for a documented
disability should contact Disability Concerns at 350 Fell Hall, 309‐438‐5853,
<http://www.disabilityconcerns.ilstu.edu>.

Other Sources of Support
========================

Life at college can get very complicated. Students sometimes feel overwhelmed,
lost, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationship
difficulties or diminished self-esteem. Many of these issues can be
effectively addressed with a little help. Student Counseling Services (SCS)
helps students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. Student
Counseling Services is staffed by experienced, professional psychologists and
counselors, who are attuned to the needs of college students. The services are
free and completely confidential. Find out more at
<http://counseling.illinoisstate.edu> or by calling 309-438-3655.

Academic Misconduct
===================

Academic integrity is expected and required. Students are expected to be
honest in all academic work. A student's placement of his or her name on any
academic exercise shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result
of the student’s own thought, effort, and study.

If you have questions, refer to the Code of Student Conduct, B1 (Academic
Integrity), which outlines unacceptable behaviors in academic matters, or talk
to me. In certain circumstances (such as cheating or plagiarism) I may be
required to refer a student to Community Rights & Responsibilities for a
violation of Illinois State University's Code of Student Conduct.

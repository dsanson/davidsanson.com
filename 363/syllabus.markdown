# Course Description

The title of this course is "Topics in Metaphysics and Epistemology." Each
time I teach it, I choose a different topic to focus on. This term, our focus
will be on truth and reality.

What is truth? What are truths? How is truth related to meaning? Is moral
truth the same kind of thing as scientific truth? What is reality? What does
it mean to be a realist or an anti-realist? Can something be true *for me* but
not true *for you*? Can something be real *for me* but not real *for you*? Can
truth outstrip reality? How is truth related to fiction? How is fiction
related to reality? And what to say about sentences like, 'this sentence is
not true'?

Books
=====

I have not yet decided whether or not to order books for this course. 

The literature on truth and reality is huge. You are also encouraged to search
for books and articles on topics that catch your interest. A good place to
start is [PhilPapers.org][].

Assignments
===========

Your grade will be based upon

-   homework exercises (10%),
-   "levels papers" (50%),
-   a final paper (30%),
-   participation (10%)

Homework exercises will be assigned occasionally throughout the term as
appropriate and graded pass/fail. "Levels papers" are explained in detail
below. The final paper will be a longer paper on a topic of your choice,
determined in consultation with me.

Participation
-------------

This will be a small discussion based class. It is essential that everyone
participates. This means that you must come to each class, and you need to
come to each class prepared. Before each class you need to do the reading and
think about it.

Levels Papers[^1] {#levels-paperslev}
-----------------

The "levels papers" are modeled after video game mechanics. There are three
levels for you to progress through, and you are allowed to progress to the
next level only after you have completed the previous level. Just as with
levels in video games, the idea here is to insure that you are always working
on a task that is challenging enough to be interesting, but not so challenging
that it is frustrating. Each of the levels will help prepare you to write the
final paper for the course (writing the final paper is kind of like the "boss
battle" for this course).

Your “levels grade” is determined by how far you progress through the levels.
You have a maximum of five attempts at the levels, each due on a specific day
(see schedule). After attempting a level, you will receive one of four
evaluations: “not much progress”, “good effort”, “almost”, or “complete”. Each
attempt must be written on one of the readings covered since the last attempt
was due (hence, each attempt will be on a new topic---you will not be
rewriting the previous attempt). Your levels grade will be determined by how
far through the levels you progress, and which evaluation you get on the last
level you attempt, according to the following scale:

Level 3
:   Complete = A, Almost = A-, Good Effort = B+, Not much progress = B

Level 2
:   Complete = B-, Almost = C+, Good Effort = C, Not much progress = C-

Level 1
:   Complete = D, Almost = D-, Good Effort = F, Not much progress = F

The complete instructions for each level are as follows:

**Level 1**. Expository paper, between 150 and 300 words. Choose one
particular argument from the readings and explain that argument in a very
short paper. We will be doing some exercises during the first couple of weeks
of class that will prepare you to write this paper.

**Level 2**. Expository paper, between 400 and 600 words. This paper will be
just like level 1, except that you will explain two arguments from the reading 
that have some important relationship to one another. For example, you
might choose to discuss an argument and then another argument that is an
objection to the first. Alternatively, you might choose a second argument
that builds on the first argument. There are other possibilities as well — the
only requirement is that the two came from the readings and have some
interesting relationship to one another. (When you write your paper, you
should make it clear just what the relationship is.) As this paper now has a
bit of complexity, make sure to include an introductory paragraph that briefly
explains what your paper is going to be about and how it will proceed.

**Level 3**. Expository and critical paper, between 700 and 1000 words. This
will be just like level 2, except that you will also argue that one of the
arguments you discuss is unsound (i.e., that it either has a false premise or
a bad inference). Your criticism here must be original, and you should be sure
to defend your criticism against potential objections.

You have a maximum of five attempts at the levels. The deadlines for those
five attempts are:

Attempt 1
:   Feb 17th

Attempt 2
:   March 3rd

Attempt 3
:   March 24th

Attempt 4
:   April 11th

Attempt 5
:   May 2nd

Getting in Touch
================

Email is the best way to reach me when I am not in my office. I am not always
online and I cannot always respond immediately. If I have not responded in 24
hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won't
take this as harassment). Include "363" in the subject line of your email and
your full name somewhere in the body of your email, so I know who you are(!),
and that the email is related to this class.

Disabilities
============

Any student needing to arrange a reasonable accommodation for a documented
disability should contact Disability Concerns at 350 Fell Hall, 309‐438‐5853,
<http://www.disabilityconcerns.ilstu.edu>.

Other Sources of Support
========================

Life at college can get very complicated. Students sometimes feel overwhelmed,
lost, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationship
difficulties or diminished self-esteem. Many of these issues can be
effectively addressed with a little help. Student Counseling Services (SCS)
helps students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. Student
Counseling Services is staffed by experienced, professional psychologists and
counselors, who are attuned to the needs of college students. The services are
free and completely confidential. Find out more at
<http://counseling.illinoisstate.edu> or by calling 309-438-3655.

Academic Misconduct
===================

Academic integrity is expected and required. Students are expected to be
honest in all academic work. A student's placement of his or her name on any
academic exercise shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result
of the student’s own thought, effort, and study.

If you have questions, refer to the Code of Student Conduct, B1 (Academic
Integrity), which outlines unacceptable behaviors in academic matters, or talk
to me. In certain circumstances (such as cheating or plagiarism) I may be
required to refer a student to Community Rights & Responsibilities for a
violation of Illinois State University's Code of Student Conduct.

# Choose Your Own Adventure

This schedule is intentionally incomplete. We will begin by getting a
background in early 20th Century debates about truth, how they feed into
Tarski's important work on truth. We then look at one key episode where truth
has been used as a weapon against anti-realists: the Frege-Geach problem for
moral expressivism.

Where we go from there will depend on class interest. We might look at
attempts to understand the difference between realists and anti-realists in
terms of truth, and some recent arguments against this. This would naturally
lead to the literature on alethic pluralism---the view that there are many
different kinds of truth. We might look at relationship between truth and
various forms of relativism. We might look at the contemporary literature on
"Truthmaker Principles". We might look at truth in fiction. And we might look
at attempts to solve the Liar Paradox. To do all of this would be too much, so
we will have to make some decisions together.

Avicenna, *al-Nafs* I.1 (Marmura 1986, 387):

> He will not doubt his affirming his self existing, but with this he
> will not affirm any limb from among his organs, no internal organ,
> whether heart or brain, and no exernal thing. Rather, he would be
> affirming his self without affirming for it length, breadth and depth.
> And if in this state he were ble to imagine a hand or some other
> organ, he would not imagine it as part of his self or a condition for
> its existence.
>
> You know that what is affirmed is other than what is not affirmed and
> what is acknowledged is other than what is not acknowledged. Hence the
> self whose existence he has affirmed has a special characteristic of
> its being his very self, other than his body and organs that have not
> been affirmed.
>
> Hence the one who affirms has a means to be alerted to the existence
> of the soul as something other than the body---indeed, other than
> body---and to his being directly acquainted with this existence and
> aware of it. If he is oblivious to this, he would require educative
> prodding. 

Avicenna, *al-Nafs* V.7 (Marmura 1986, p. 390):

> We say: If a human is created all at once, created with his limbs
> separated and he does not see them, and if it happens that he does not
> touch them and they do not touch each other, and he hears no sound, he
> would be ignorant of the existence of the whole of his organs, but
> would know the existence of his individual being as one thing, while
> being ignorant of all the former things. What is itself the unknown is
> not the known.

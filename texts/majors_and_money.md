Mid-career, philosophy majors earn more than biology majors, literature
majors, history majors, language majors, communications majors,
psychology majors… and earn about the same as political science majors.

Don’t let someone talk you into *not majoring in philosophy* but
majoring in one of these other majors instead because *philosophy is
impractical* and *philosophy majors end up flipping burgers*. That is
bullshit.

Descartes's indubitable facts are his own thoughts--using "thought" in
the widest possible sense. "I think" is his ultimate premiss. Here the
word "I" is really illegitimate; he ought to state his ultimate
premiss in the form "there are thoughts." The word "I" is
grammatically convenient, but does not describe a datum. When he goes
on to say "I am a thing which thinks," he is already using
uncritically the apparatus of categories handed down by scholasticism.
He nowhere proves that thoughts need a thinker, nor is there reason to
believe this except in a grammatical sense.

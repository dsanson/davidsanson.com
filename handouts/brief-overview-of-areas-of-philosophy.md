title: Brief Overview of the Areas of Philosophy
...

The word 'philosophy' comes from Greek, and translates literally as 'love of
wisdom'. Exactly what philosophy is or should be is something philosophers
argue about, but philosophy tends to focus on fundamental questions: What is
knowledge? What is beauty? What is truth? What is justice? What is happiness?
What is the nature of reality?

Philosophy has seven traditional subdisciplines:

**Metaphysics**
:   The study of what there is and how things are. Questions include: Do the
    ordinary objects, like tables and chairs, trees and donkeys, really exist?
    Do abstract things like numbers, geometric shapes, and the color red,
    really exist? If so, what are they like? Does God exist? What are time and
    space? What is it to be a person? Do people have free will?

**Epistemology**
:   The study of knowledge. Questions include: What is knowledge? Can we
    really know anything? Does all knowledge depend on experience, or are
    there some things we can know by reason alone? Can I know something
    without knowing that I know it?

**[Logic](/logic)**
:   The study of correct and incorrect reasoning. Questions include: Which
    forms of reasoning are valid and which invalid? What makes a logical
    truth---like 'if snow is white, then snow is white'---true?

**Ethics**
:   The study of how we ought to live and how we ought to act. Questions
    include: Why are wrong acts wrong and good acts good? What is happiness,
    and how ought one to live in order to be happy? Are there some kinds of
    act that are absolutely morally wrong no matter the consequences, or does
    the rightness or wrongness of an act always depend on its consequences?

**Social and Political Philosophy**
:   The study of how we ought to live together. Questions include: What sort
    of governments are just and what sorts unjust? Are there limits on the
    just exercise of state power against individuals? If so, what are they? Do
    individuals have an obligation to obey laws that they disagree with?

**Aesthetics**
:   The study of beauty and the arts. Questions include: Is beauty subjective
    or objective? What makes things beautiful? What is a work of art? Is art
    supposed to beautiful?

It can also be useful to distinguish areas of philosophical inquiry that cut
across these traditional subdisciplines, but are united by a common subject
matter. For example,

**Philosophy of Science**
:   The study of philosophical problems that concern the nature of science and
    scientific practice.

Some of questions addressed by philosophy of science have to do with
metaphysics: Does physics describe the fundamental nature of reality? Does
General Relativity show that time is not real? Does Quantum Mechanics show
that reality is observer dependent? What is a biological species? Are
biological species real?

Others have to do with epistemology, logic, ethics, social and political
philosophy, or even aesthetics (must good scientific theories be "beautiful"?)

Other examples of areas like this include **Philosophy of Mind**, **Feminist
Philosophy**, **Philosophy of Language**, **Philosophy of Religion**,
**Philosophy of Law**, **Philosophy of Race**, **Philosophy of Mathematics**,
and **Environmental Philosophy**.

Finally, philosophers are often interested in studying the history of
philosophy, and how positions and approaches vary and develop over time and
across cultures. So we sometimes talk about **Ancient (Greek)
Philosophy**, **Medieval Philosophy**, **Modern Philosophy**, and so on, and
we talk about **Western Philosophy** and **Eastern Philosophy**, or---since
philosophical traditions have often been tied fairly closely to religious
traditions---**Buddhist Philosophy**, **Hindu Philosophy**, **Christian
Philosophy**, **Jewish Philosophy**, **Islamic Philosophy**, etc.

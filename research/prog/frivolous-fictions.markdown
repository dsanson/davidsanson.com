"Frivolous Fictions", in progress.

> I explore the possibility of providing a non-commital paraphrase of
> quantification over fictional characters, along the lines of the
> non-commital paraphrase Kit Fine provides for quantification over
> possibilia. Building on this foundation, we can say that names for
> fictional characters are *weakly non-referring*, in Nathan Salmon's
> sense. The resulting view nicely splits the middle between Fictional
> Realist views, that posit existing abstract fictional characters, and
> Fictionalist and Pretense Theoretic views, that maintain that names
> for fictional characters are *strongly non-referring*. But all is not
> rosy: the paraphrase is problematic in various ways, providing us with
> an opportunity to reflect more broadly on the metaphysical commitments
> of this sort of paraphrasing strategy, when applied to fiction,
> modality, and time.

"Frivolous Fictions"

I explore a non-commital paraphrase of quantification over fictional
characters, based on the non-commital paraphrase Kit Fine provides for
quantification over possibilia. And I explore the view that names for
fictional characters are *weakly non-referring*, in Nathan Salmon's
sense. One goal is to bring out some ontological differences between
fictional characters and possibilia.

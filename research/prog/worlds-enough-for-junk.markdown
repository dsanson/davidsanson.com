"[Worlds Enough for Junk](http://files.davidsanson.com/research/worlds-enough-for-junk.pdf)," under revision.

> A *cap* is something that is not a proper part. A *junky* thing is not
> part of any cap. The existence of a single junky thing, *j*, entails
> the existence of an infinite upward hierarchy of junky things: each thing
> *j* is a proper part of, is itself a proper part of something else,
> which is proper part of something else... Can there be junky things?
> Against the backdrop of Lewis's Modal Realism, it is hard to see how
> there could be: every possibility involves the existence of a world,
> and that world is a cap. But this can be overcome, by allowing that
> parts of possible worlds collectively represent complete
> possibilities. Thinking this through helps throw the Modal Realist's
> project into sharper relief.

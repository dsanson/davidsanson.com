"[Frivolous
Fictions](http://dx.doi.org/10.11612/resphil.2016.93.2.8)" forthcoming in *Res
Philosophica* (93:2) 2016 ([penultimate draft](/frivolous_fictions.pdf)).

I explore a non-commital paraphrase of quantification over fictional
characters, based on the non-commital paraphrase Kit Fine provides for
quantification over possibilia. And I explore the view that names for
fictional characters are *weakly non-referring*, in Nathan Salmon's
sense. One goal is to bring out some ontological differences between
fictional characters and possibilia.

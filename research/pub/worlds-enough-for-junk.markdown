"[Worlds Enough for Junk](http://files.davidsanson.com/research/worlds-enough-for-junk.pdf)," forthcoming in *Res Philosophica*.

A *cap* is something that is not a proper part. A *junky* thing is not
part of any cap. Can there be junky things? Against the backdrop of
Lewis's Modal Realism, it is hard to see how there could be: every
possibility involves the existence of a world, and that world is a cap.
But this can be overcome, by allowing that parts of possible worlds
collectively represent complete possibilities. Thinking this through
helps throw the Modal Realist's project into sharper relief.

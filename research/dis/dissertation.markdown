The core of the dissertation is the argument in "Once Present, Now
Past". It also contains a critical discussion of one interpretation of
the view Michael Tooley defends in *Time, Tense, and Causation* (1997).
On that interpretation, Tooley's view---that we can understand temporary
facts only by supposing that reality is fundamentally relative to
times---ends up looking a lot like the "external relativism" that Kit
Fine describes in "Tense and Reality" (2005).

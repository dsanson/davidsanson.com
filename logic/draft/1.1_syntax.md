# What is This?

This is a supplement to sections 1.1 and 1.2 of the Logic Text. You should read those *before* you read this.

# Conditionals and Negations

Chapter 1 introduces a fragment of **Sentential Logic**, focusing just
on the logic of 'if' and 'not'. The rest of Sentential Logic---including
the logic of 'and', 'or', and 'if and only if'---is introduced in
chapter 2. We start with just this fragment to keep things simple, so
you can get a sense of how logic works without getting overwhelmed by a
large number of new symbols and rules.

You just read the first two sections of Chapter 1. The first section
introduces a new symbolic notation---two new symbols, '$\Lneg$' and
'$\Lif$'---together with some rules for combining those symbols
with **sentence letters**---capital letters P through Z---and
parentheses to produce **symbolic sentences**.

The second section explains what the new symbols mean. '$\Lneg$' is the
negation sign, and we use it to symbolize 'it is not the case that'.
'$\Lif$' is the conditional sign, and we use it to symbolize
'if...then...'.

# Review: Negations 

Our symbolic sentences are built up out of the two new symbols, the
sentence letters, and parentheses.

We use the sentence letters---capital letters P through Z---to represent
simple sentences. (we will use capital letters A through O later for
another purpose.)

We use the '$\Lneg$' to symbolize negations. A negation is a sentence
that is true just in case the sentence it negates is false.

Suppose we are at a party, and you ask for a beer, and I say,

-  There are some beers in the refrigerator.

You go look, but you don't find any beer. So you say,

-  There are not any beers in the refrigerator.

At this point, we would probably send somebody on a beer run. But maybe the party is a logic party, so
we decide to translate our conversation into symbols instead.

We can represent my sentence with a single sentence letter,

-   $R$: There are some beers in the refrigerator.

Your sentence is the **negation** of my sentence. What you said was true
just case what I said was false, and vice versa. So, using our negation
sign, we can represent your sentence as,

-   $\Lneg R$

Here are some other examples of sentences and their negations, together with appropriate symbolizations:

 Sentence                                              Negation                                              
 ----------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------- 
 $S$: Snow is white                                      $\Lneg S$: Snow is not white                                         
 $T$: Frozen is the greatest musical of all time         $\Lneg T$: Frozen isn't the greatest musical of all time            
 $R$: The NSA respects the rights of US citizens         $\Lneg R$: The NSA fails to respect the rights of US citizens 

As these examples show, in English we tend to express negations by
including a 'not' somewhere in the middle of the sentence, but we can
also use contractions or expressions like 'fails to'.

Not all sentences that involve negativity are negations. Consider:

1.   Canada is the best!
2.   Canada is the worst!

\(2) is not the negation of (1), because (2) is not true just in case (1)
is false. Maybe Canada is neither the best nor the worst. The negation of (1) is

3.   Canada is not the best.

Not all sentences that differ just by a 'not' are negations. Consider:

1.   I want to eat a cupcake.
2.   I want to not eat a cupcake.

Again, (2) isn't the negation of (1), because (2) is not true just in case (1) is false: maybe I am indifferent about cupcakes. The negation of (1) is:

3.   I don't want to eat a cupcake.

So, if you are not sure whether one sentence is the negation of the
other, ask yourself: is it true just in case the other is false?

## Test Your Understanding

I.  Suppose $Z$ stands for 'The level of zooplankton in the Great Lakes is dangerously high.'
    What English sentence does $\Lneg Z$ symbolize?

<div class="answers">
It symbolizes the sentence, 'The level of zooplankton in the Great Lakes is not dangerously high'.
</div>

II.  What English sentence expresses the negation of 'Satan is evil'?

<div class="answers">

'Satan is good' is not the negation of 'Satan is evil': maybe Satan is neither good nor evil, but so-so. So the negation of 'Satan is evil' is 'Satan is not evil', or 'Satan fails to be evil'.

</div>

III. How would you symbolize, 'It is not the case that the levels of zooplankton in the 
    Great Lakes are not dangerously high'?

<div class="answers">

'It is not the case' adds a second negation, so the natural way to
symbolize this is as $\Lneg\Lneg Z$, which is the negation of
$\Lneg Z$.

$Z$ and $\Lneg\Lneg Z$ stand in an interesting logical relationship.
$Z$ is true just in case its negation, $\Lneg Z$, is false. And
$\Lneg\Lneg Z$ is false just in case *its* negation, $\Lneg\Lneg Z$,
is true. So $Z$ is true just in case $\Lneg\Lneg Z$. In other words,
they are *logically equivalent*.

</div>


# Review: Conditionals

We use the conditional sign, '$\Lneg$', to represent conditionals. A
**conditional** is an if...then... statement, like

@a.   If you eat all the popcorn, then I will be sad.

The **antecedent** of the conditional is the "if" part, so, in this case,

-   $P$: You eat all the popcorn.

The **consequent** is the "then" part, so,

-   $S$: I will be sad.

So we can represent (@a) as

@b.   $(P\Lif S)$

Now suppose I want to deny (@a): my happiness does not depend on your eating habits! I can do this by expressing the 
negation of the conditional,

@c.  $\Lneg(P\Lif S)$

or, in English,

@d.  It is not the case that if you eat all the popcorn, then I will be sad.

The parentheses are important. Maybe my happiness *does* depend on your
eating habits, but not in the way that (@a) suggests. Maybe I *want* you
to eat all the popcorn, and if you don't, I am going to be sad. That is,

@e.  If you don't eat all the popcorn, then I will be sad.

\(@e) is a conditional. Its antecedent is,

-   $\Lneg P$: You don't eat all the popcorn,

and its consequent is,

-   $S$

So we can symbolize (@e) as,

@f.  $(\Lneg P\Lif S)$

Study the difference between (@c) and (@f). In (@c), the negation sign
is inside the parentheses. In (@f), it is outside. Can you see how that
captures the difference between (@d)---the denial of the truth of the
conditional---and (@e)---a conditional with a negation as its
antecedent? If we didn't have parentheses, we could not capture this
distinction.

English is often ambiguous. The same word can have multiple meanings:
'bank', for example, can mean *financial institution*, or it can mean
*side of a river*. English is also *syntactically* ambiguous---the same
sentence, with the same grammar and punctuation, can have multiple
interpretations. An internet search for "syntactically ambiguous
newspaper headlines" will give you several examples, including:

![Students Cook and Serve Grandparents](/images/grandparents.jpg)

-   British Left Waffles on Falkland Islands
-   Dr. Ruth to Talk about Sex with Newspaper Editors
-   Squad Helps Dog Bite Victim
-   Stolen Painting Found by Tree
-   Enraged Cow Injures Farmer with Ax

We don't want ambiguity like this in our symbolic language. Parentheses
are the tool we use to avoid it.

## Test Your Understanding

I.  What is the antecedent of this conditional: 'If you can't love the one you want, love the one you're with'?

<div class="answers">
The antecedent is 'You can't love the one you want'.
</div>

II. What is the consequent of this conditional: $((P\Lif Q)\Lif R)$

<div class="answers">
The consequent is $R$. The antecedent is $(P\Lif Q)$. Do you see how the parentheses help guide you here?
</div>

## Review: Informal Notation

Parentheses are *really* important! Without them, our symbolic sentences
would be ambiguous. But they can make our sentences look cluttered and
hard to read. So sometimes we allow ourselves to write sentences in
**informal notation**, which means we get to leave some of the
parentheses out.

But informal notation does not mean anything goes. We have strict rules
concerning when parentheses can be omitted. For now, we only have one
rule:

-   If the symbolic sentence, in formal notation, begins with a left
    parenthesis and ends with a right parenthesis, you can omit them.

So, a sentence like $(P\Lif Q)$ can be written as $P\Lif Q$. But you
cannot omit any of the parentheses from a sentence like
$\Lneg(P\Lif Q)$, because it does not begin with a parenthesis---it
begins with a negation sign.

Also, please note that there is no convention or rule---formal or informal---that
lets you *add* parentheses willy-nilly. $(P\Lif Q)$ is a symbolic sentence; $((P\Lif Q))$ is not.

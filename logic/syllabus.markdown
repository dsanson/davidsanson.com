My office is Stevenson 341. My email is <desanso@ilstu.edu>. My office
hours for this term are MW 3:15-4:15, or by appointment.

The Philosophy Department currently employs four logic tutors, who are
available by appointment. They are: Elizabeth Fansler (<emfansl@ilstu.edu>),
Katie Gennrich (<kegennr@ilstu.edu>), Rudy Negrete (<rnegre2@ilstu.edu>),
and Grant Skocaj (<gjskoca@ilstu.edu>).

Course Description
==============

*Logic* is the study of correct and incorrect reasoning. Logicians want
to understand what makes good reasoning good and bad reasoning bad. This
helps us avoid making mistakes in our own reasoning, and it allows us to
evaluate the reasoning of others. But the importance of logic goes
beyond this. Logic lies at the foundations of mathematics, linguistics,
cognitive science, computer science, and philosophy.

This course provides an introduction to the basic concepts and methods
used by logicians. Our focus will be on *formal* logic. We will explore
the logic of 'not', 'if', 'and', 'or', and 'if and only if', 'every',
and 'some'. You will learn how to symbolize arguments in a way that
makes their logical form perspicuous, and you will learn techniques for
determining whether or not symbolized arguments are good or bad.

Course Objectives
=================

This course is both a GenEd course in the category of Quantitative
Reasoning, and a course required for the philosophy major. Here is how
the University describes the GE category:

> "In Quantitative Reasoning courses, students examine the principles,
> practices, instruments, and systems of mathematics and logic used to
> measure, quantify, analyze, and represent social, scientific,
> technological, and other phenomena as a basis for decision-making."


Whatever your major, this course will make you a better reasoner. You
will learn how to formally represent a given line of reasoning, and how to
evaluate whether it is good or bad. You will get better at seeing how
different pieces of information can "fit together" to entail new
information. Although this course has no writing component, many of you
will find that it improves your analytic writing skills, as you get a
better sense of how to marshal your evidence in support of a conclusion.

Again, no matter your major, this course will give you exposure to and
appreciation of the methods of formal logic. Though much of our time
will be spent learning *how to do* logic, we will occasionally step back
and reflect on the relevance of logic to broader questions about the
nature of language, the role of reason in mathematics, the nature of
truth, and the nature of rationality.

The course will also enable you to read and understand the symbolic
formulas of modern formal logic---a skill somewhat akin to the ability
to read and understand algebraic formulas. This is valuable in its own
right, as it gives you a powerful tool for thinking about the form your
reasoning takes, just as algebra gives you a powerful tool for thinking
about numerical relationships, and geometry gives you a powerful tool
for thinking about spatial relationships. This is skill is especially
essential for philosophy majors, as contemporary work in philosophy
assumes a basic literacy in symbolic logic.

For the philosophy major, this course can either be seen as a useful
supplement to other philosophy courses, or as the gateway to some of the
more "technical" fields in contemporary philosophy, such as Philosophy
of Language, Philosophy of Math, and Philosophical Logic, and the more
"technical" parts of contemporary Philosophy of Mind, Epistemology (the
Theory of Knowledge), and Metaphysics (the Theory of Being).

Course Requirements
===================

Software and Text
-----------------

You do not need to purchase a text for this course. You do need to
download a free software program:

-   [Logic 2010: A Workbook][]: <http://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu>

The software runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems (if you
need help getting it set up on Linux, ask), but it will not run on iOS,
Android, or Chrome OS. The software requires Java. Before
installing, be sure to read the instructions on the download page for
your operating system, and be sure to read the document, [Installing,
Starting, Registering, and Backing Up in Logic 2010.][], which is linked
to at the top of the download page.

The software is installed on the public computers on floors 2, 4, 5, and 6 of
Milner Library and the computer in the Philosophy Department student lounge,
Stevenson 412A.

The software comes with a free online textbook, *An Exposition of
Symbolic Logic*, by Terry Parsons. I will refer to this book as "The
Logic Text". The documentation that comes with the software sometimes
refers to it as the Logic Text and sometimes as the "Terry
Text". Once you have installed the software, you can access the Logic
Text by clicking on the "Logic Text" button.

I have also created an [online supplement] to the Logic Text. 

  [Logic 2010: A Workbook]: http://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu
  [Installing, Starting, Registering, and Backing Up in Logic 2010.]: https://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu/Logic/Documents/CORE/Vanilla_Installing_Starting_..._LOGIC_2010_v1.pdf
  [online supplement]: http://www.davidsanson.com/logic/supplements/

The software and the Logic Text are both based off of a classic
logic textbook,

-   Donald Kalish, Richard Montague, and Gary Mar (1980). *Logic:
    Techniques of Formal Reasoning*, 2nd edition. Harcourt: Fort Worth.

Advanced students may wish to look to that textbook for additional insight and exercises.

Graded Assignments
------------------

Your grade will be based on homework and exams, broken down as follows:

------------------------------  ----
**Homework**                     20%
**First Midterm** (Week 5)       25%
**Second Midterm** (Week 10)     25%
**Final** (Finals Week)          30%
------------------------------  ----


**Attendance is required**, but I am not going to make a habit of "taking"
attendance. Instead, I will make a habit of cold-calling at random. If I
cold-call you at random and you are not present, I will take note. Each time
this happens, your grade for the course will drop by 1%. 

Homework
--------

Logic is a skill, and it takes practice to get good at it. Homework will give
you that practice.

Homework will be due twice a week. Most homework will be completed and
submitted using the Logic 2010 software, and will be due by midnight the day
before each class meeting. You will only get credit for problems that are
completed correctly.

Late homework submissions will receive 1/2 credit. This means that you have very good
reason to complete your homework on time, but you also have very good reason,
should you fail to complete your homework on time, to complete it late.

Exams
-----

Exams will be completed in-class using the software. I am currently working
to find an available computer lab that can fit us all and that are available
during our class times. If that proves impossible, exams will instead be
completed in class on paper.

<!--
Exams will be closed-notes and closed-book and in class, completed
without the aid of software. You will need to supply your own bluebook
for the exam. There will be an opportunity to correct your midterm exams
in order to improve your score.

Course Difficulty and Course Speed
-----------------------------------

Many of you will find this course quite challenging. Some of you will
find it quite easy. Logic requires an unfamiliar combination of
mathematical and linguistic skills. For some people, this combination
comes easy; for others, it is a struggle.

I try to keep the course moving at an appropriate rate: I want *most* of
you to feel constantly challenged, but not overwhelmed. **For some of
you, this rate will be too fast, and you will be overwhelmed**. If this
happens to you, please **come get help**. Come to my office hours, make
appointments with me and with the tutors: we are friendly and we are
here to help! Experience shows that struggling students who make use of
our help do much better than those who do not.

Some of you may find the rate too slow, and begin to get bored. Again,
come talk to me: we can only cover so much in class, but logic has a lot
to offer. I'd be happy to work out an accelerated program that allows
you to go further and dig deeper.

Course Websites
===============

There are two websites associated with this course: 

<http://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu>
:   This is where you go to download the
    Logic 2010 software. It is also where you go to find homework assignments
    and check your scores on homework assignments and exams.



<http://www.davidsanson.com/logic>
:   Here you will find the syllabus and the supplement to the textbook.


Getting in Touch
================

Email is the best way to reach me when I am not in my office. I am not
always online and I cannot always respond immediately. If I have not
responded in 24 hours please email me again, letting me know it is your
second email (I won't take this as harassment). Include "112" in the
subject line of your email and your full name somewhere in the body of
your email, so I know who you are(!), and that the email is related to
this class.

There is also a "Feedback" button within the Logic 2010 software, which
allows you to send an email both to me and to the authors of the
software program. This is a good way to report software bugs or
suggested improvements to the software.

Disabilities
============

Any student needing to arrange a reasonable accommodation for a
documented disability should contact Disability Concerns at 350 Fell
Hall, 309‐438‐5853, <http://www.disabilityconcerns.ilstu.edu>.

Other Sources of Support
========================

Life at college can get very complicated. Students sometimes feel
overwhelmed, lost, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with
relationship difficulties or diminished self-esteem. Many of these
issues can be effectively addressed with a little help. Student
Counseling Services (SCS) helps students cope with difficult emotions
and life stressors. Student Counseling Services is staffed by
experienced, professional psychologists and counselors, who are attuned
to the needs of college students. The services are free and completely
confidential. Find out more at <http://counseling.illinoisstate.edu> or
by calling 309-438-3655.

Academic Misconduct
===================

Academic integrity is expected and required. Students are expected to be
honest in all academic work. A student's placement of his or her name on
any academic exercise shall be regarded as assurance that the work is
the result of the student’s own thought, effort, and study.

If you have questions, refer to the Code of Student Conduct, B1
(Academic Integrity), which outlines unacceptable behaviors in academic
matters, or talk to me. In certain circumstances (such as cheating or
plagiarism) I may be required to refer a student to Community Rights &
Responsibilities for a violation of Illinois State University's Code of
Student Conduct.

# Instructions

This is an assignment to be completed *on paper*, and turned in in class. All problems are worth 10 points each, and will be added to the points you have earned on the quizzes and the Logic 2010 homework assignments.

# Symbolization

@.  'unless' is another way of saying \_\_\_\_\_\_\_?
@.  How do we symbolize 'Every A is B'?
@.  How do we symbolize 'Some A is B'?
@.  How do we symbolize 'Only As are Bs'?
@.  How do we symbolize 'No A is B'?
@.  Explain why '$\Lsome x(Ax\Lif Bx)$' can be true when 'Some As are
    Bs' is false, and so is not the right way to symbolize 'All As are
    Bs'.
@.  Explain why '$\Lall x(Ax\Land Bx)$' can be false when 'All As are
    Bs' is true, and so is not the right way to symbolize 'All As are
    Bs'.


# Arguments

For each of the following arguments, complete the following tasks:

a.  Think through the argument without the help of our tools, and decide
    whether or not you think it is valid. Write down your answer (it is
    okay if this turns out to be wrong).
b.  Symbolize the argument (10 pts).
c.  If the argument is invalid, construct a model that shows this (10 pts).
d.  If the argument is valid, construct a derivation that shows this (10 pts).

@.  All dogs go to heaven. Fido is a dog. So Fido goes to heaven.
@.  Only dogs go to heaven. Fido is a dog. So Fido goes to heaven.
@.  All dogs go to heaven. So everything that goes to heaven is a dog.
@.  Some dogs are evil. Nothing evil goes to heaven. So some dogs don't go to heaven.

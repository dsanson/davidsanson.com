# Validity and Soundness

Complete the following definitions:

4.  An argument is valid just in case ______?

5.  An argument is sound just in case ______?

# Symbolize and Derive

Symbolize each of the following arguments (10 pts), and then show that they are valid by constructing derivations (10 pts):

6. We won't defeat the terrorists if we lose our moral authority. Moreover, if we torture detainees, we lose our moral authority. So, we won't defeat the terrorists if we torture detainees.

7. Humans don't share a common language. If there were a natural connection between words and the ideas they stand for, all humans would share a common language. Moreover, the connection between words and the ideas is arbitrary if it is not natural. So the connection between words and the ideas for which they stand is arbitrary.

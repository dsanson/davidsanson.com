What is Logic?
==============

**Logic** is the study of correct and incorrect reasoning. Logicians want to
understand what makes good reasoning good and what makes bad reasoning bad.
Understanding this helps us to avoid making mistakes in our own reasoning,
and it allows us to evaluate the reasoning of others. It makes us better
thinkers.

![Aristotle (384-322 BCE)][aristotle]

The [first logician was Aristotle][] (384-322 BCE). But the logic we use and
study these days---sometimes called "Modern Logic" or "Contemporary
Logic"---was developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Important early
works include George Boole's *[The Laws of Thought][]* (1854), and [Gottlob
Frege][]'s *Begriffsschrift* ("Concept Script") (1879) and *Grundgesetze der Arithmetik* ("Basic Laws of Arithmetic) (1892).

![George Boole (1815-1864)][]

Logic lies at the foundation of mathematics, where it allows us to provide a
clear and rigorous account of mathematical proof. It also plays a central role
in philosophy, where we use it to help reason as clearly and rigorously as
possible about hard questions about ourselves, about knowledge, reality,
truth, and beauty, and about right and wrong, good and bad. It also lies at
the foundation of computer science: a computer is a logic machine. And a mind
is, at least in part, a logic machine too, so logic lies at the foundation of
cognitive science and philosophy of mind. It also lies at the foundation of
linguistics, providing the tools we use for thinking about linguistic
structure (syntax) and linguistic meaning (semantics).

![Gottlob Frege (1848-1925)][]

Logic is one of the [traditional sub-disciplines of Philosophy][] and one of
the seven traditional "[liberal arts][]", alongside arithmetic, geometry,
astronomy, music, grammar, and rhetoric. In a medieval university, students
would begin by studying grammar, logic, and rhetoric, before going on
to study  the other four liberal arts. Advanced students might then study
philosophy and theology. (At the time, "philosophy" included disciplines we would 
now categorize as "sciences", like physics, biology, and psychology.)

So there are many good reasons to study logic. It will make you more medieval.
It will give you insight into linguistics, the foundations of mathematics, and
computer science. It will make you a better philosopher. And it will make you a
better thinker.

Representing Reasoning
======================

Logic aims to develop a theory of good and bad reasoning. But before we can
evaluate a given piece of reasoning, we need a way to represent it.

## The Structure of Reasoning 

When we reason, we reason *from* some given information *to* some new
information. We might represent this using a visual diagram:

~~~{.dot}
digraph G {
   graph [rankdir=UD]
   premise -> conclusion:n;
   premise [label="given information", shape="box"];
   conclusion [label="new information", shape="box"];
   }
~~~

We will call a piece of reasoning an **argument**. We will call the
information you reason from the **premises**, and the information you reason
to the **conclusion**:

~~~{.dot}
digraph G {
   premise -> conclusion:n;
   premise [label="premises", shape="box"];
   conclusion [label="conclusion", shape="box"];
   }
~~~

So, for example, given the information that Andrew is vegetarian, you
might reason to the conclusion that Andrew does not eat chicken:

~~~{.dot}
digraph G {
   graph [rankdir=UD]
   premise -> conclusion:n;
   premise [label="Andrew is vegetarian", shape="box"];
   conclusion [label="Andrew does not each chicken", shape="box"];
   }
~~~

But this diagram leaves a lot of important information out. When you reasoned
from the premise to the conclusion, you relied your background knowledge about
vegetarians and chickens. This gave you additional information, and so
additional premises. Here is a more explicit representation of your reasoning: 


~~~{.dot}
digraph G {
   graph [rankdir=UD]
   premise -> conclusion:n;
   premise [shape="record", label="Andrew\ is\ vegetarian | Vegetarians\ don't\ eat\ animals | Chickens\ are\ animals"];
   conclusion [shape="box", label="Andrew does not each chicken"];
   }
~~~

Notice that the conclusion does not follow from any one of the premises taken
by itself. It only follows from all the premises taken together. So we cannot
represent this as three separate arguments for the same conclusion.

We can also reason from one or more premises to one or more conclusions: 

~~~{.dot}
digraph G {
   graph [rankdir=UD]
   premise -> conclusion:n;
   premise [shape="record" label="Alice,\ Bob,\ and\ Christina\ are\ teammates
   | Alice\ is\ the\ tallest\ player\ on\ her\ team"];
   conclusion [shape="record", label="Alice\ is\ taller\ than\ Bob| Alice\ is\ taller\ than\ Christina"];
   } 
~~~

Notice that here each conclusion follows separately from the premises. So we can represent this as two separate arguments, from the same premises, but to different conclusions:

~~~{.dot}
digraph G {
   graph [rankdir=UD]
   premise -> conclusion:n;
   premise [shape="record" label="Alice,\ Bob,\ and\ Christina\ are\ teammates
   | Alice\ is\ the\ tallest\ player\ on\ her\ team"];
   conclusion [label="Alice is taller than Bob", shape="box"];
   } 
~~~

~~~{.dot}
digraph G {
   graph [rankdir=UD]
   premise -> conclusion:n;
   premise [shape="record" label="Alice,\ Bob,\ and\ Christina\ are\ teammates
   | Alice\ is\ the\ tallest\ player\ on\ her\ team"];
   conclusion [label="Alice is taller than Christina", shape="box"];
   } 
~~~

When we reason from some premises to more than one conclusion, it is always
possible to represent the reasoning in this way, with separate arguments. So,
for the sake of simplicity, we will do this, and assume that an argument
always has exactly one conclusion.

These diagrams provide a nice visual way of representing arguments. We began
with them to help emphasize the basic structure of an argument: an argument is
a piece of reasoning, from some given information, to a conclusion.

## Premise-Conclusion Form

In practice, it is much easier to represent an argument as a simple list:
first the premises, followed by the conclusion. So, for example, we can
represent the argument above as,

1.  Alice, Bob, and Christina are teammates.
2.  Alice is the tallest player on her team.
3.  ∴ Alice is taller than Christina.

Here the premises are (1) and (2), and the conclusion is (3). We know that (3)
is the conclusion because it is the last sentence in the list. We also know
that it is the conclusion because it is marked by a special symbol, '∴'
which stands for "therefore". We will always mark conclusions using '∴'.

When we represent arguments like this---as a list of premises, followed by the
conclusion---we say that we have put the argument in **premise-conclusion
form**. Putting arguments in premise-conclusion form is a common philosophical
exercise. It forces you to clearly separate out the premises from each other,
and from the conclusion.

**Test Your Understanding**

Research shows that it is easy to read something and feel like you understand
it, even when you don't. Most of us feel like we understand so long as we
know what most of the words in a sentence mean, even if we don't really grasp
the ideas being communicated.

So, throughout these supplements, you will be provided with opportunities to
stop and test your understanding. Please don't skip this. If you get a
question wrong, go back and re-read the preceding paragraphs with an eye to
figuring out what you missed.

</div>

Arguments are everywhere. You can find them in blogs, magazine articles,
textbooks, and newspaper editorials. They often pop up in conversations. But
they are not usually found in premise-conclusion form, and important premises
are often left unstated. Sometimes even the conclusion is left unstated, as in
this example, from Confucius:

>| If there be righteousness in the heart,
>| there will be beauty in the character.
>| If there be beauty in the character,
>| there will be harmony in the home.
>| If there be harmony in the home,
>| there will be order in the nation.
>| If there be order in the nation,
>| there will be peace in the world.^[Borrowed from Pospesel, p. 76.]

Can you put this argument in premise-conclusion form? What is the conclusion?
When you think you know the answer, click on the gray box below.

<div class='answers'>

Presumably the conclusion is,

-   If there be righteousness in the heart, there will be peace in the world.

So the argument, in premise-conclusion form, would be,


1.  If there be righteousness in the heart, there will be beauty in the
    character.
2.  If there be beauty in the character, there will be harmony in the home.
3.  If there be harmony in the home, there will be order in the nation.
4.  If there be order in the nation, there will be peace in the world.
5.  ∴ If there be righteousness in the heart, there will be peace in the world.

Here is an argument:

> Some pigs have wings. Everything with wings can fly. So, some pigs can fly.

What are the premises of this argument? What is its conclusion? Can you put it
in premise-conclusion form? When you think
you know the answer, click on the gray box below:

<div class="answers">

The premises are 'Some pigs have wings' and 'Everything with wings can fly'.
The conclusion is 'Some pigs can fly'. In English, the words 'so' and 'hence'
and 'therefore' are often used to indicate a conclusion. In this case, the
fact that the last sentence begins with 'So' tells us that it is the
conclusion.

1.  Some pigs have wings.
2.  Everything with wings can fly.
3.  ∴ Pigs can fly.

</div>

Here is another argument:

> We need to raise the capital gains tax. We need to do this because a low capital gains tax provides a disproportionate benefit to the wealthiest citizens. It serves only to increase the gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of us, and we need to decrease that gap.

What are the premises of this argument? What is the conclusion?

<div class="answers">

The conclusion is, 'We need to raise the capital gains tax.' Notice that when
people give arguments, they don't always state the conclusion last, and they
don't always mark it with a word like 'so' or 'therefore'.

The first premise is 'A low capital gains tax provides a disproportionate benefit to
the wealthiest citizens.' Notice the way the word 'because' is used to
indicate that this is a premise---a bit of information that helps support the
conclusion. Another word that often indicates a premise is 'since'.

Here is the argument in premise-conclusion form:

1.  A low capital gains tax provides a disproportionate benefit to the
    wealthiest citizens.
2.  A low capital gains tax serves only to increase the gap between the
    super-wealthy and the rest of us.
3.  We need to decrease the gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of us.
4.  ∴ We need to raise the capital gains tax.

# Review and a Loose End

We've introduced three key terms: **argument**, **premise**, **conclusion**,
They are defined in terms of each other:

<div class="boxed">

**Arguments, Premises, Conclusions**
:   An **argument** is piece of reasoning that can be represented as a list of
    sentences, called the **premises**, followed by a sentence, called the
    **conclusion**. 

</div>

And we've introduced a way of representing arguments, by putting them in
**premise-conclusion** form.

We need to add one qualification to our definition of an argument. The sentences that play the role of premises or conclusions must be
sentences that express information. So they have to be *declarative
sentences*---the kinds of sentences that are true or false. They cannot be
questions or commands, since questions and commands are not used to express
information.

So this is *not* an argument:

1.  It is important to eat fruits and vegetables.
2.  ∴ Eat your fruits and vegetables!

Why not?

<div class="answers">

This is not an argument because the conclusion is an imperative sentence---a
sentence used to give a command---rather than a declarative sentence---a
sentence used to say something true or false.

It is possible to develop a logic that includes imperatives. Computer
programming languages often involve imperatives. Consider:

1.  If the user clicks on the icon, then open the app!
2.  The user has clicked on the icon.
3.  ∴ Open the app!

We might think of this as an argument from one imperative---the command
expressed by (1)---to another imperative---the command expressed by (3). But
the logic of imperatives (like the logic of questions) is an advanced topic,
to be considered after you have mastered the material of this course.

title: Logical Form and Formal Validity
...

Logical Form and Formal Validity
================================

Often, the validity of an argument is connected to its **logical form**.
Consider:

<div class="cor">

1.  No <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="cars"> are
    <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" style="width:10em" placeholder="allowed in the park">.
2.  All
    <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" style="width:8em" placeholder="police cruisers">
    are <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="cars">.
3.  Therefore, all
    <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" style="width:8em" placeholder="police cruisers">
    are not
    <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" style="width:10em" placeholder="allowed in the park">.

Arguments of this form are always valid. No matter what noun or noun
phrase you plug in to
<input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="cars">, <input
class="copyMe B slot" type="text" style="width:10em" placeholder="allowed in the park">,
and <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" style="width:8em"
placeholder="police cruisers">, if the premises are true, the conclusion
will be true too.

(Try it: click on the box containing 'cars' and type in 'mammals'; click
on the other boxes and type in 'egg-layers' and 'platypus'. Is the
resulting argument valid?)

</div>

<div class=".cor">

Here is another argument form that involves three terms:

1.    Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As">
    are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs">
2.    Some <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs">
    are <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs">
3.  ∴ Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As">
    are <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs">

Arguments of this form are not always valid. Can you find values for
<input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As">,
<input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs">, and
<input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"> that make
both of the premises true and the conclusion false?

</div>

<div class="answers">

Here is one way to do it: let 'As' be 'cats'; let 'Bs' be 'animals'; let
'Cs' be 'dogs'.

</div>

According to our official definition, validity has to do with what is or
isn't possible. To check whether or not a given argument is valid, we
try to imagine a possible situation in which all the premises are true
but the conclusion is false:

In the previous section, we saw that validity had to do with what is or
isn't possible: is it possible that all the premises be true but the
conclusion false? Figuring out what is or isn't possible requires a lot
of imagination, and it isn't always clear what we should say.[^1]

But formal validity is more straightforward.

<div class="boxed">

**Formal Validity**
:   An argument is **formally valid** just in case there is no argument
    with the same logical form that has all true premises and a false
    conclusion.

</div>

We can test the formal validity of an argument by trying to find an
argument that has the same logical form whose premises are *actually*
true, and whose conclusion is *actually* false.

Let's practice.

The following form is invalid. Show this by finding values for 'A', 'B',
and 'C' that make the premises true and the conclusion false.

1.    Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As">
    are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs">
2.     All <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs">
    are not <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs">
3.  ∴  All <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As">
    are not <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs">

<div class="answers">

Here is one way to do it: let 'A' be 'numbers', 'B' be 'odd numbers',
and 'C' be 'divisible by two'. Then the premises are both true, but the
conclusion is false.

Here is another way to do it: let 'A' be 'animals', 'B' be 'dogs', and
'C' be 'cats'.

</div>

Is this form valid? Try to find values for 'A', 'B', and 'C' that make
the premises true and the conclusion false.

1.    All <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are
    <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs">
2.    All <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"> are
    <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs">
3.  ∴ All <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are
    <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs">

<div class="answers">

The form is valid. No matter what nouns you plug in for 'A', 'B', and
'C', if the premises are true, the conclusion will be true too.
Aristotle called this argument form "Barbara".

Notice that we cannot really *show* that the argument is valid. All we
can do is try to come up with an example that shows that it is invalid.
When we cannot come up with any such examples, how can we be sure that
this is not simply due to our lack of imagination?

</div>

Is this form valid?

1.    Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As">
    are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs">
2.  ∴ Some <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs">
    are <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As">

<div class="answers">

Yes, it is.

</div>

Sentential Logic: 'if' and 'not'
================================

In the previous section, we took the common nouns that occurred in an
argument---words like platypus and police car---to be the
non-logical *content* of an argument---and we took the words that
surrounded them---words like all, some, no, not, and are---to
indicate the logical form of the argument.

The resulting logic is called **Term Logic** (or sometimes
**Aristotelean Logic**, because this was the sort of logic that
Aristotle developed). It is also called **Traditional Logic**, because
it was the logic most widely used throughout the medieval and early
modern periods. But this is not the only way one might think about
logical form.

<div class="cor">

Consider the following argument:

1.  If
    <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width:12em" placeholder="the governor is corrupt">,
    then
    <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width:17em" placeholder="he should be thrown in prison">.
2.  <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width:12em" placeholder="the governor is corrupt">
3.  ∴
    <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width:17em" placeholder="he should be thrown in prison">.

This argument is valid: any possible situation that makes both premises
true makes the conclusion true too.

Further, the argument is formally valid. Replace
<input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width:12em" placeholder="the governor is corrupt">
with any sentence, and
<input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width:17em" placeholder="he should be thrown in prison">
with any sentence, and the resulting argument will also be valid. Try
it, by typing in other sentences into the box and the circle.

</div>

Here is another argument, similar but slightly different in form:

1.  If capital punishment deterred crimes, then it is justified.
2.  Capital punishment does not deter crimes.
3.  ∴ Capital punishment is not justified.

Is this argument valid? The answer may not be immediately obvious. We
can represent the form of the argument as,

1.  If <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" >, then
    <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" >
2.  It is not the case that <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" >
3.  ∴ It is not the case that <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" >

Can you find sentences that, when plugged into the box and circle, make
the premises true but the conclusion false? (Note that the box and
circle are still interactive: you can type sentences into them.)

<div class="answers">

Try plugging in 'Hilary Clinton is President' into the box and 'a
Democrat is President' into the circle. Then the premises are both true,
but the conclusion is false.

</div>

This invalid form of argument is a fairly common **logical
fallacy**---that is, logical mistake people make when reasoning. It is
common enough that it has a name: *denying the antecedent*.

To understand that name, you need to know a few more technical terms. We
call an 'if ... then ...' sentence a **conditional**. We call the
'if'-part of a conditional the **antecedent**, and we call the
'then'-part the **consequent**. So, for example, here is a conditional:

-   If Bonzo is an ape, then he should go to bed,

The antecedent is 'Bonzo is an ape'. The consequent is 'Bonzo should go
to bed'. So, to *deny* the antecedent of this conditional would be to
say that the Bonzo is not an ape.

Here are four common forms of argument that involve conditionals. Which
are valid and which are invalid?

<div class="boxed">

**Modus Ponens**:

> If <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" >, then
> <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" >.\
> <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" >\
> $∴$ <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" >

</div>

<div class="boxed">

**Denying the Antecedent**

> If <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" >, then
> <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" >.\
> It is not the case that <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" >\
> $∴$ It is not the case that <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" >

</div>

<div class="boxed">

**Affirming the Consequent**

> If <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" >, then
> <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" >.\
> <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" >\
> $∴$ <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" >

</div>

<div class="boxed">

**Modus Tollens**: If P, then Q. It is not the case that Q. ∴ It is not
the case that P.

> If <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" >, then
> <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" >.\
> It is not the case that <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" >\
> $∴$ It is not the case that <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" >

</div>

Which of these four forms are valid, and which invalid? Try to work out
your answer before clicking the box below.

<div class="answers">

The first and last forms, with the weird Latin names, are valid. The
other two are invalid. For the invalid forms, can you come up with
sentences that make the premises true but the conclusion false?

</div>

There are other ways to combine sentences to form new more complicated
sentences. For example, given the sentences
<input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder='Bonzo is an ape'>
and
<input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder='Reagan was President'>,
we can form sentences like,

-   <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder='Bonzo is an ape'>
    and
    <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder='Reagan was President'>.

-   <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder='Bonzo is an ape'>
    or
    <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder='Reagan was President'>.

-   <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder='Bonzo is an ape'>
    just in case
    <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder='Reagan was President'>.

These examples all share an important feature: the truth or falsehood of
the complex sentence is a function of the truth or falsehood of its
component parts.

This isn't always true. Consider,

-   <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 22em" placeholder='Renacci voted against the gun control bill'>
    because
    <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder='The NRA gave Renacci $9,900'>.

Both of the component sentences are true. The NRA gave Senator Jim
Renacci \$9,900 in support of his 2012 election campaign, and Renacci
voted against a gun control bill. But that is not enough to tell us
whether or not the complex sentence is true, whether the contribution in
fact influenced his vote.

Review
------

The aim of this page was to provide you a first introduction to logic.
Key terms that were defined include **logic**, **argument**,
**premise**, **conclusion**, **valid**, **sound**, **formally valid**,
**conditional**, **antecedent**, and **consequent**. You were introduced
to two kinds of logical form---the sort studied by term logic and the
sort studied by sentential logic. In the next chapter, we will begin
developing sentential logic.

[^1]: Cows are mammals. Might they not have been? If not, the argument

    1.  Grass is green.
    2.  ∴ Cows are mammals.

    is valid, by our definition. Is it formally valid?

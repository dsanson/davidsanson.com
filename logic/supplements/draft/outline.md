# What is This

This is an outline for an interactive logic text keyed to Logic 2010.

The goals for the text are:

-   some interactive element between every two paragraphs.

It is too easy for students to read through something and feel like they got the "gist" of it without really processing any of it. By constantly asking the students to stop and apply or process what they just read, I hope to foster greater comprehension.

-   interleaving of content

I don't want to teach Syntax, Symbolization, Derivations, Truth Tables as separate units. I want each unit to cross-fertilize with the others. At a minimum, this means that once a new topic or technique has been introduced, we continue to apply it across other contexts. It also means that we might first introduce derivations, then truth tables, then more difficult derivations, for example.

-   get students to think more about practical applications (use Pospesel)

I don't want this to be an "applied" logic class, but I want the students to appreciate the power the techniques in application to things they actually care about. Something like Pospesel gives the students a chance to *practice* application. I want to also encourage the students to try to find arguments in things they are reading for other classes, and use our tools to analyze them.

-   theoretical concepts

I want the course to reinforce certain foundational concepts---validity, logical form, argument vs. sentence, truth vs. validity etc. I don't want it to be a course where we spend so much time solving problems that we lose track of the big picture.

## Ideas:

-   one regular weekly exercise for the students: find an argument in your
    reading for another class that you can symbolize and assess its
    validity.
-   follow the Logic Book in constantly reemphasizing the same basic concepts
-   lower expectations for what students are able to derive
-   raise expectations for what students are able to symbolize

# Recognizing Arguments

These skills need to be interleaved into each section of the text:

-   Identifying Premises and Conclusion
-   Distinguishing Arguments from Explanations
-   Testing for Validity:
    -   intuitive tests: Imagining possible situations
    -   formal tests applied informally
    -   formal tests applied formally
-   Testing for Truth
    -   counterexamples
    -   material conditionals
-   Identifying Implicit Premises

# Basic Concepts

-   Argument, Premise, Conclusion
    -   Conclusion markers
    -   Premise markers
-   Evaluating Arguments: Valid, Sound, Inductively Strong
-   Logical Form and Formal Validity
-   Logical Truth

# Sentential Logic

-   Symbols, syntax, translation, simple symbolization

Exercises: parsing; translation; symbolization; plugging-in

-   Idiomatic symbolization
    -   stylistic variants
        -   neither...nor... and both...not...
    -   complex subjects and predicates
    -   ambiguity and commas
    -   ambiguity and if...then, either...or, both...and
    -   ambiguity and complex subjects and predicates

Exercises: symbolize sentences; symbolize arguments

-   Basic rules and direct derivations

Exercises: rule recognition; spot-the-error; derivations; symbolize and derive arguments

-   Truth tables

Exercises: spot-the-error; truth tables for single sentences; truth tables for arguments; symbolize and apply truth tables to arguments

-   Conditional Derivations and Indirect Derivations

Recognition; spot-the-error; derivations; symbolize and derive and truth table

-   Harder derivations and derived rules

Recognition; spot-the-error; derivations; symbolize and derive and truth table

-   Basic Concepts of Metatheory
    -   syntax vs. semantics
    -   validity vs. derivability
    -   soundness and completeness

Exercises: defining away connectives; why would some new rule render our system unsound? how many rules do we need for our system to be complete?

# Monadic Predicate Logic

-   Symbols and syntax
-   Translation and simple symbolization (sentences AND arguments)
-   Basic rules (plus QN) and derivations
-   Countermodels

# Predicate Logic with Relations and Identity

-   Syntax: Relations and Identity
-   Symbolization: Relations and Identity
-   Rules for Identity
-   Some simple derivations

<h1 id="what-is-this">What is This?</h1>
<p>This is a brief introduction to logic. Some key concepts are introduced, some examples are given of how to apply those concepts, and a little bit is said about how logic fits into the larger scheme of things. The most important concepts are in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-logic">What is Logic?</h1>
<p><strong>Logic</strong> is the study of correct and incorrect reasoning. Logicians want to understand what makes good reasoning good and what makes bad reasoning bad. Understanding this allows us to avoid making mistakes in our own reasoning, and it allows us to evaluate the reasoning of others.</p>
<p>Logic lies at the foundation of mathematics, where it allows us to provide a clear and rigorous account of mathematical proof. It also plays a central role in philosophy, where we use logic to help us reason as clearly and rigorously as possible about hard questions about ourselves, and about knowledge, reality, truth, beauty, good and bad.</p>
<p>Logic also lies at the foundation of computer science: a computer is a logic machine. And a mind is, at least in part, a logic machine too, so logic lies at the foundation of cognitive science and philosophy of mind.</p>
<p>It also lies at the foundation of linguistics, providing the tools we use for thinking about linguistic structure (syntax) and linguistic meaning (semantics).</p>

<p>Logic is one of the <a href="/handouts/brief-overview-of-areas-of-philosophy.html">traditional sub-disciplines of Philosophy</a> and one of the seven traditional &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_liberal_arts#Seven_liberal_arts">liberal arts</a>&quot;, alongside arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, grammar, and rhetoric. In a medieval university, students would begin by studying grammar, logic, and rhetoric, before going on to study the four other liberal arts. Advanced students might then study philosophy and theology. (At the time, &quot;philosophy&quot; included what we would now call the &quot;natural sciences&quot;: physics, biology, psychology, chemistry.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/">first logician was Aristotle</a> (384-322 BCE). But the logic we use and study these days---sometimes called &quot;Modern Logic&quot; or &quot;Contemporary Logic&quot;---was developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Important early works include George Boole's <em><a href="http://gutenberg.org/ebooks/15114">The Laws of Thought</a></em> (1854), and [Gottlob Frege's][] <em>Begriffsschrift</em> (&quot;Concept Script&quot;), (1879) and <em>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik</em> (&quot;Basic Laws of Arithmetic) (1892).</p>
<h1 id="representing-reasoning">Representing Reasoning</h1>
<p>Logic aims to develop a theory of good and bad reasoning. But before we can evaluate a given piece of reasoning, we need a way to represent it.</p>
<p>When we reason, we reason <em>from</em> some given information <em>to</em> some new information. We can represent this using a visual diagram:</p>

<p>We call a piece of reasoning an <strong>argument</strong>, the information you reason from a <strong>premise</strong>, and the information you reason to the <strong>conclusion</strong>.</p>
<p>So, for example, given the information that that Andrew is vegetarian, you might reason to the conclusion that Andrew does not eat chicken:</p>

<p>But this diagram leaves something out. When you reasoned from the premise to the conclusion, you relied on some additional information---your background knowledge about vegetarians and chickens. This additional information gave you some additional premises to reason from. Here is a more explicit representation of your premises and conclusion:</p>

<p>As this example shows, we often reason from several premises to a given conclusion. Notice that, in the example, the conclusion does not follow from any one of the premises, taken by itself. It only follows from all the premises, taken together.</p>
<p>We can also reason from some premises to several different conclusions. We could represent such reasoning as all of one piece:</p>

<p>These diagrams provide a nice visual way of representing an argument. But it is often more convenient to represent an argument as a simple list of the premises followed by the conclusion:<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/nocars.png" alt="No Cars Allowed" /><figcaption>No Cars Allowed</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol type="1">
<li>No cars are allowed in the park.</li>
<li>All police cruisers are cars.</li>
<li>Therefore, all police cruisers are not allowed in the park.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here the premises are (1) and (2), and the conclusion is (3). We know that (3) is the conclusion because it is the last sentence in the list. We also know that it is the conclusion because it is marked by the word 'therefore'. Because we are going to be looking at a lot of arguments, it is useful to introduce a special symbol for marking conclusions, '∴', which can be read as &quot;therefore&quot;.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p><strong>Premise-Conclusion Form</strong>. When we represent an argument as a list of premises followed by the conclusion, we say that we have put it in <strong>premise-conclusion form</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>Arguments are everywhere. You can find them in blogs, magazine articles, textbooks, and newspaper editorials. They often pop up in conversations. But they are not usually presented in premise-conclusion form. So the first practical skill you need to learn, if you want to apply the tools of logic, is the skill of representing these arguments in premise-conclusion form.</p>
<p>For the sake of practice, it is helpful to have lots of examples. Happily, a textbook with many nice examples has been made available for free online.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p><strong>Test Your Understanding</strong></p>
<p>Research shows that it is easy to read something and feel like you understood it, even when you didn't. Most of us feel like we understand so long as we know what most of the words in a sentence mean, even if we don't really grasp the ideas being communicated.</p>
<p>So, throughout these supplements, you will be provided with opportunities to stop and test your understanding. Please don't skip this. If you get a question wrong, go back and re-read the preceding paragraphs with an eye to figuring out what you missed.</p>
</div>
<p>Here is an argument:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Some pigs have wings.</li>
<li>Everything with wings can fly.</li>
<li>Therefore, some pigs can fly.</li>
</ol>
<p>What are the premises of this argument? What is its conclusion? When you think you know the answer, click on the gray box below:</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>The premises are 'Some pigs have wings' and 'Everything with wings can fly'. The conclusion is 'Some pigs can fly'.</p>
</div>
<p>Here is another argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to raise the capital gains tax. We need to do this because a low capital gains tax provides a disproportionate benefit to the wealthiest citizens. It serves only to increase the gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of us, and we need to decrease that gap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the premises of this argument? What is the conclusion?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>The conclusion is, 'We need to raise the capital gains tax.' The premises are 'A low capital gains tax provides a disproportionate benefit to the wealthiest citizens,' 'A low capital gains tax serves only to increase the gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of us,' and 'we need to decrease the gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of us.'</p>
</div>
<h1 id="soundness-and-validity">Soundness and Validity</h1>
<p>Consider again the argument,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No cars are allowed in the park.</li>
<li>All police cruisers are cars.</li>
<li>Therefore, all police cruisers are not allowed in the park.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a good argument. The third sentence, (3), <em>follows</em> from the first two sentences. If we assume that (1) and (2) are true, then (3) must be true as well.</p>
<p>Here is another argument:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No mammals lay eggs.</li>
<li>All platypus are mammals.</li>
<li>Therefore, all platypus don't lay eggs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, this is also a good argument, in just the same way: the third sentence <em>follows</em> from the first two. If we assume that (1) and (2) are both true, then (3) must be true too.</p>
<p>But there is also a clear sense in which this is a <em>bad</em> argument, since the first premise is false: some mammals do lay eggs. And the conclusion is false: platypus do lay eggs. If someone were to give you this argument in an attempt to convince you that platypus don't lay eggs, you would not be convinced!</p>
<p>So arguments are kind of like friends. Just as a friend can be good in one way but bad in another---a good listener but bad at keeping secrets, say---an argument can be good in one way but bad in another. This means that we need to distinguish two senses in which an argument can be good or bad.</p>
<p>The first sense in which an argument can be good is called <em>validity</em>. To say that an argument is valid is to say that the premises, if they were true, would guarantee the truth of the conclusion. That is, more precisely,</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>An argument is <strong>valid</strong> just in case it is impossible for all of its premises to be true but its conclusion false.</p>
</div>
<p>Remember that an argument is a piece of reasoning, <em>from</em> some given information---the premises---<em>to</em> some new information---the conclusion. When we ask whether or not an argument is valid, we are not asking about the quality of the information; we are only asking about the quality of the reasoning from that information to the conclusion:</p>

<p>Here is an example of an invalid argument:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If Obama is President, then a Democrat is President.</li>
<li>A Democrat is President.</li>
<li>∴ Obama is President.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I write this, (1), (2) and (3) are all true. But the argument is not valid: it is perfectly possible that (1) and (2) be true but (3) false, because it is perfectly possible that some other Democrat be President.</p>
<p>So the following argument is valid:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The world is either round or flat.</li>
<li>If the world is round, people on the bottom of the world fall off.</li>
<li>People on the bottom of the world don't fall off.</li>
<li>∴ The world is flat.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we say that this argument is valid, we are saying that there is nothing wrong here with the reasoning: if we assume that (1), (2), and (3) are all true, then (4) must be true as well.</p>
<p>The second sense in which an argument can be good is called <em>soundness</em>.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>An argument is <strong>sound</strong> just in case it is valid and all of its premises are true.</p>
</div>
<p>You are probably familiar with the saying &quot;Garbage in, garbage out&quot;. When you reason from false premises, even if your reasoning is valid, you have no reason to suppose that your conclusion is true. So when we ask whether or not an argument is sound, we are not just asking about the quality of the reasoning, but <em>also</em> about the quality of the information that we are reasoning from:</p>

<p>The argument above, for the conclusion that the world is flat, is valid but it is not sound, because premise (2) is false: it is not true that if the world were round, people on the bottom would fall off.</p>
<p>, and the second has to do with the actual <em>truth</em> or <em>falsehood</em> of the premises. Logic is not concerned with the actual truth or falsehood of premises or conclusion. If you want to know whether or not mammals lay eggs, ask a biologist, not a logician. Logic is concerned with whether the conclusion <em>would</em> follow, if the premises <em>were</em> true.</p>

<p><em>Whether the premises be true or false, is not a question of logic, but of morals, philosophy, history or any other knowledge to which their subject-matter belongs. The question of logic is: does the conclusion certainly follow if the premises be true?</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="de-morgan1840a">[@de-morgan1840a, p. 3]</span></p>
</div>
<p>It is time to test your understanding, by applying these definitions to some examples.</p>
<p>Here is an argument:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Some pigs have wings.</li>
<li>Everything with wings can fly.</li>
<li>∴ Some pigs can fly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is it valid? Is it sound?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>It is not sound, because both of the premises are false (why is (2) false?) But it is valid!</p>
</div>
<p>What about this argument? Is it valid? Sound?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A good university must have a good library.</li>
<li>ISU has a good library.</li>
<li>∴ ISU is a good university.</li>
</ol>
<div class="answers">
<p>It is not valid: suppose (1) and (2) were both true; that's not be enough to guarantee the truth of (3). Perhaps a good university must have both a good library <em>and</em> a great football team, for example.</p>
<p>Since it is not valid, it is not sound.</p>
</div>
<p>Can a valid argument have a false conclusion? If so, what would an example be?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>Yes, a valid argument can have a false conclusion. We've already seen an example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Some pigs have wings.</li>
<li>Everything with wings can fly.</li>
<li>∴ Some pigs can fly.</li>
</ol>
<p>To check if the example you came up with was correct, ask yourself two questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is the conclusion false?</li>
<li>If all the premises were true, would the conclusion have to be true too?</li>
</ol>
<p>If the answer to both of these question is yes, then your example was correct.</p>
</div>
<p>Can a valid argument with all true premises have a false conclusion? If so, what would an example be?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>No! If the argument is valid, then there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true, but the conclusion false. So if all the premises are in fact true, the conclusion must in fact be true too.</p>
</div>
<p>Can a valid argument have false premises but a true conclusion? If so, what would an example be?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>Yes! Here is one example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fish are mammals.</li>
<li>Whales are fish.</li>
<li>∴ Whales are mammals.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Suppose you know that an argument is sound. What do you know about its conclusion? Stop and think about this---the answer is implicit in the definitions of validity and soundness just given.</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>If an argument is sound, all of its premises are true and it is valid. That is (plugging in the definition of validity), all of its premises are true and it is impossible for all of its premises to be true but its conclusion false. So we know that its conclusion is not false. So we know that its conclusion is true.</p>
</div>
<p>In philosophy---and, indeed, in daily life---we want our arguments are sound. As responsible reasoners, we want to be reasoning <em>validly</em> from true premises, and so to true conclusions.</p>
<p>For example, it is easy to come up with a <em>valid</em> argument for the existence of God, but hard to come up with an uncontroversially <em>sound</em> argument for the existence of God. Try it! Try to formulate a <em>valid</em> argument whose conclusion is 'God exists'. Are the premises uncontroversially true?</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>That was an open-ended question, so I hope you didn't click on this box hoping for an answer! Here is one example of a valid argument for the existence of God:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The moon is made of green cheese.</li>
<li>If the moon is made of green cheese, then God exists.</li>
<li>∴ God exists.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is valid----if the premises were true, the conclusion would have to be true too. But the first premise is clearly false, so the argument is not sound.</p>
<p>Here is another example of a valid argument for the existence of God:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Bible says God exists.</li>
<li>Everything the Bible says is true.</li>
<li>∴ God exists.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, this is valid---if the premises were true, the conclusion would have to be true too. But is it sound? Are the premises true? Some Christians believe that it is---they believe that both premises are true. But many Christians and most non-Christians will reject premise (2), claiming that it is false. Who's right and who's wrong? That's not a question that logic alone can answer.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>Famously, Paul says, in Titus 1:12-13,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. This witness is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But logic tells us that these two sentences cannot both be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Cretan said, &quot;Every Cretan always lies.</li>
<li>What that Cretan said was true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this show that premise (2) is false?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again, it is easy to come up with a <em>valid</em> argument for the non-existence of God, but hard to come up with an uncontroversially <em>sound</em> argument for that same conclusion. Try it!</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>Here is an example of a valid argument that is obviously unsound:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The moon is made of green cheese.</li>
<li>If the moon is made of green cheese, then God doesn't exist.</li>
<li>∴ God doesn't exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example of a valid argument whose soundness is unclear:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If God existed, there would be no evil in the world.</li>
<li>There is evil in the world.</li>
<li>∴ God does not exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some philosophers argue that (1) and (2) are both true, and so the argument is sound. Others reject the truth of (1) or (2), claiming that the argument is valid but not sound. Who's right and who's wrong? Again, not a question that can be answered by logic alone.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>We've introduced five key terms: <strong>argument</strong>, <strong>premise</strong>, <strong>conclusion</strong>, <strong>valid</strong>, <strong>sound</strong>. The first three are defined in terms of each other:</p>
<div class="boxed">
<dl>
<dt><strong>Arguments, Premises, Conclusions</strong></dt>
<dd>An <strong>argument</strong> is piece of reasoning that can be represented by a set of sentences, called the <strong>premises</strong>, followed by a sentence, called the <strong>conclusion</strong>. The conclusion is supposed to follow from the premises.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>We should add one further point of clarification: the sentences that are used to express the premises and the conclusion must be <em>declarative sentences</em>---that is, the kinds of sentences that are true or false. They cannot be questions or commands, for example.</p>
<p>And then we have our definitions of soundness and validity:</p>
<div class="boxed">
<dl>
<dt><strong>Validity</strong></dt>
<dd>An argument is <strong>valid</strong> just in case it is impossible that all the premises be true but the conclusion false.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Soundness</strong></dt>
<dd>An argument is <strong>sound</strong> just in case it is valid and all of its premises are true.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> an argument. Can you explain why?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is important to eat fruits and vegetables.</li>
<li>∴ Eat your fruits and vegetables!</li>
</ol>
<div class="answers">
<p>This is not an argument because the conclusion is an imperative sentence---a sentence used to give a command---rather than a declarative sentence---a sentence used to say something true or false.</p>
<p>It is possible to develop a logic that includes imperatives, but that is beyond the scope of this course. Computer programming languages often take this form. Consider:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the user clicks on the icon, then open the app!</li>
<li>The user clicks on the icon.</li>
<li>∴ Open the app!</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="logical-form-and-formal-validity">Logical Form and Formal Validity</h2>
<p>Often, the validity of an argument is connected to its <strong>logical form</strong>. Both of our sample arguments from the previous section---the one about the cars and the one about the platypus---have the same logical form. Consider:</p>
<div class="cor">
<ol type="1">
<li>No <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="cars"> are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" style="width:10em" placeholder="allowed in the park">.</li>
<li>All <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" style="width:8em" placeholder="police cruisers"> are <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="cars">.</li>
<li>Therefore, all <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" style="width:8em" placeholder="police cruisers"> are not <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" style="width:10em" placeholder="allowed in the park">.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the boxes above is actually a text input box: you can type in anything you want. Try replacing <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="cars"> with 'mammals', <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" style="width:10em" placeholder="allowed in the park"> with 'egg-layers', and <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" style="width:8em" placeholder="police cruisers"> with 'platypus'.</p>
</div>
<p>Any argument with this logical form will be valid. Play around with it: plug in any terms---that is, any common nouns or noun phrase---into the form. Each time, note whether or not the premises and conclusion are true.</p>
<p>Now for a more focused challenge. To say that the argument is formally valid is to say that there are no terms that make the premises all true and conclusion false. So, try plug plugging in terms that make the premises all true. Once you've done that, the conclusion will be specified. Is it true or false?</p>
<p>Now try plugging in terms that make the conclusion false. Once you've done that, all but one of the terms will be specified. Can you find a value for that third term that makes one of the premises false?</p>
<div class=".cor">
<p>Here is another argument form that involves three terms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>  Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"></li>
<li>  Some <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"> are <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
<li>∴ Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is formally invalid. Can you find values for <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As">, <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs">, and <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"> that make both of the premises true and the conclusion false?</p>
</div>
<div class="answers">
<p>Here is one way to do it: let 'As' be 'cats'; let 'Bs' be 'animals'; let 'Cs' be 'dogs'.</p>
</div>
<p>Valid arguments are often valid in virtue of their logical form. We say that such arguments are <em>formally valid</em>.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<dl>
<dt><strong>Formal Validity</strong></dt>
<dd>An argument is <strong>formally valid</strong> just in case there is no argument with the same logical form that has all true premises and a false conclusion.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>We can test the formal validity of an argument by trying to find an argument that has the same logical form whose premises are actually true, and whose conclusion is actually false.</p>
<p>Let's practice.</p>
<p>The following form is invalid. Show this by finding values for 'A', 'B', and 'C' that make the premises true and the conclusion false.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>  Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"></li>
<li>   All <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"> are not <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
<li>∴  All <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are not <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
</ol>
<div class="answers">
<p>Here is one way to do it: let 'A' be 'numbers', 'B' be 'odd numbers', and 'C' be 'divisible by two'. Then the premises are both true, but the conclusion is false.</p>
<p>Here is another way to do it: let 'A' be 'animals', 'B' be 'dogs', and 'C' be 'cats'.</p>
</div>
<p>Is this form valid? Try to find values for 'A', 'B', and 'C' that make the premises true and the conclusion false.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>  All <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"></li>
<li>  All <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"> are <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
<li>∴ All <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe C slot" type="text" placeholder="Cs"></li>
</ol>
<div class="answers">
<p>The form is valid. No matter what nouns you plug in for 'A', 'B', and 'C', if the premises are true, the conclusion will be true too. Aristotle called this argument form 'Barbara'.</p>
<p>Notice that we cannot really <em>show</em> that the argument is valid. All we can do is try to come up with an example that shows that it is invalid. When we cannot come up with any such examples, how can we be sure that is not simply due to our lack of imagination?</p>
</div>
<p>Is this form valid?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>  Some <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"> are <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"></li>
<li>∴ Some <input class="copyMe B slot" type="text" placeholder="Bs"> are <input class="copyMe A slot" type="text" placeholder="As"></li>
</ol>
<div class="answers">
<p>Yes, it is.</p>

<h1 id="sentential-logic-if-and-not">Sentential Logic: 'if' and 'not'</h1>
<p>In the previous section, we took the common nouns that occurred in an argument---words like 'platypus' and 'police car'---to be the non-logical <em>content</em> of an argument---and we took the words that surrounded them---words like 'all', 'some', 'no', 'not', and 'are'---to indicate the logical form of the argument.</p>
<p>The resulting logic is called <strong>Term Logic</strong> (or sometimes <strong>Aristotelean Logic</strong>, because this was the sort of logic that Aristotle developed). It is also called <strong>Traditional Logic</strong>, because it was the logic used throughout the medieval and early modern periods. But this is not the only way one might think about logical form.</p>
<div class="cor">
<p>Consider the following argument:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width:12em" placeholder="the governor is corrupt">, then <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width:17em" placeholder="he should be thrown in prison">.</li>
<li><input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width:12em" placeholder="the governor is corrupt"></li>
<li>∴ <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width:17em" placeholder="he should be thrown in prison">.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is valid: any possible situation that makes both premises true makes the conclusion true too.</p>
<p>Further, the argument is formally valid. Replace <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width:12em" placeholder="the governor is corrupt"> with any sentence, and <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width:17em" placeholder="he should be thrown in prison"> with any sentence, and the resulting argument will also be valid. Try it, by typing in other sentences into the box and the circle.</p>
</div>
<p>Here is another argument, similar but slightly different in form:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If capital punishment deterred crimes, then it is justified.</li>
<li>Capital punishment does not deter crimes.</li>
<li>∴ Capital punishment is not justified.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this argument valid? The answer may not be immediately obvious. We can represent the form of the argument as,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" >, then <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" ></li>
<li>It is not the case that <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" ></li>
<li>∴ It is not the case that <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" ></li>
</ol>
<p>Can you find sentences that, when plugged into the box and circle, make the premises true but the conclusion false? (Note that the box and circle are still interactive: you can type sentences into them.)</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>Try plugging in 'Hilary Clinton is President' into the box and 'a Democrat is President' into the circle. Then the premises are both true, but the conclusion is false.</p>
</div>
<p>This invalid form of argument is a fairly common <strong>logical fallacy</strong>---that is, logical mistake people make when reasoning. It is common enough that it has a name: <em>denying the antecedent</em>.</p>
<p>To understand that name, you need to know a few more technical terms. We call an 'if ... then ...' sentence a <strong>conditional</strong>. We call the 'if'-part of a conditional the <strong>antecedent</strong>, and we call the 'then'-part the <strong>consequent</strong>. So, for example, here is a conditional:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Bonzo is an ape, then he should go to bed,</li>
</ul>
<p>The antecedent is 'Bonzo is an ape'. The consequent is 'Bonzo should go to bed'. So, to <em>deny</em> the antecedent of this conditional would be to say that the Bonzo is not an ape.</p>
<p>Here are four common forms of argument that involve conditionals. Which are valid and which are invalid?</p>

<p><strong>Modus Ponens</strong>:</p>

</div>
<p>Which of these four forms are valid, and which invalid? Try to work out your answer before clicking the box below.</p>
<div class="answers">
<p>The first and last forms, with the weird Latin names, are valid. The other two are invalid. For the invalid forms, can you come up with sentences that make the premises true but the conclusion false?</p>
</div>
<p>There are other ways to combine sentences to form new more complicated sentences. For example, given the sentences <input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder='Bonzo is an ape'> and <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder='Reagan was President'>, we can form sentences like,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder='Bonzo is an ape'> and <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder='Reagan was President'>.</p></li>
<li><p><input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder='Bonzo is an ape'> or <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder='Reagan was President'>.</p></li>
<li><p><input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 10em" placeholder='Bonzo is an ape'> just in case <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder='Reagan was President'>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These examples all share an important feature: the truth or falsehood of the complex sentence is a function of the truth or falsehood of its component parts.</p>
<p>This isn't always true. Consider,</p>
<ul>
<li><input class="copyMe P slot" type="text" style="width: 22em" placeholder='Renacci voted against the gun control bill'> because <input class="copyMe Q slot" type="text" style="width: 15em" placeholder='The NRA gave Renacci $9,900'>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of the component sentences are true. The NRA gave Senator Jim Renacci $9,900 in support of his 2012 election campaign, and Renacci voted against a gun control bill. But that is not enough to tell us whether or not the complex sentence is true, whether the contribution in fact influenced his vote.</p>
<h2 id="review-1">Review</h2>
<p>The aim of this page was to provide you a first introduction to logic. Key terms that were defined include <strong>logic</strong>, <strong>argument</strong>, <strong>premise</strong>, <strong>conclusion</strong>, <strong>valid</strong>, <strong>sound</strong>, <strong>formally valid</strong>, <strong>conditional</strong>, <strong>antecedent</strong>, and <strong>consequent</strong>. You were introduced to two kinds of logic form---the sort studied by term logic and the sort studied by sentential logic. In the next chapter, we will begin developing sentential logic.</p>

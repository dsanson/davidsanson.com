What is This?
=============

This is a supplement to section 2.2 of the Logic Text. You should read
that *before* you read this. Section 2.2 discusses the various ways we
express conjunctions, disjunctions, and biconditionals in English.

Review
======

Conjunctions:

-   'and' sometimes occurs in coordination with 'both'. In this case,
    'both' introduces one of the conjuncts and 'and' the other.
-   there are other words in English that are equivalent to 'and':
    -   'but', 'although', 'even though'

Disjunctions:

-   'or' sometimes occurs in coordination with 'either'. In this case,
    'either introduces one of the disjuncts and 'or' the other.
-   'unless' is another way of saying 'or'.
-   for the purposes of symbolization, we will assume that 'or' in
    English is inclusive.

Biconditionals:

-   '$P$ if and only if $Q$' is equivalent to '$P$ if $Q$, and $P$ only
    if $Q$'
-   'just in case' and 'exactly on the condition that' are other ways of
    expressing the biconditional. (Compare the role here of 'just' when
    it comes before a variant of 'if' with the role of 'only' when it
    comes before a variant of 'if')

Test Your Understanding
-----------------------

Symbolize each of the following, using your own scheme of abbrevation:

1.  It rains unless I bring my umbrella.

    <div class="answers">

    $R{\mathord{\vee}}U$

    Remember: 'unless' is just another way of saying 'or'.

    </div>

2.  I bring my umbrella but it is sunny.

    <div class="answers">

    $U{\mathord{\wedge}}S$

    Remember: 'but' is just another way of saying 'and'.

    </div>

3.  Although I read the syllabus, I didn't know the requirements

    <div class="answers">

    $S{\mathord{\wedge}}R$

    'Although' is just another way of saying 'and'.

    </div>

4.  The Redbirds won exactly on the condition that their opponents lost.

    <div class="answers">

    $R{\mathord{\leftrightarrow}}P$

    'exactly on the condition that' is another way of saying 'if and
    only if'

    </div>

5.  I bring my umbrella only on the condition that it rains.

    <div class="answers">

    $U{\mathbin{\rightarrow}}R$

    Don't confuse 'only on the condition that', which is another way of
    saying 'only if', and so expresses the conditional, with 'exactly on
    the condition that', which is used to express the biconditional.

    </div>

6.  I bring my umbrella but it doesn't rain.

    <div class="answers">

    $U{\mathord{\wedge}}{\mathord{\sim}}R$

    'but' is another way of saying 'and'. The 'not' here negates the
    smallest sentence it is a part of.

    </div>

7.  It is not the case that both the Redbirds win and their opponents
    win.

8.  Both it is not the case that the Redbirds win and their opponents
    win.

    <div class="answers">

    In the (7), the negation comes before the 'both'; in (8), it comes
    after the 'both'. So

    7.  ${\mathord{\sim}}(R{\mathord{\wedge}}P)$
    8.  $({\mathord{\sim}}R{\mathord{\wedge}}P)$ (Or, in informal
        notation, ${\mathord{\sim}}R{\mathord{\wedge}}P$.)

    </div>

9.  Either I bring my umbrella but it doesn't rain, or I don't bring my
    umbrella but it rains.

    This sentence is significantly more difficult to symbolize, and
    takes us beyond section 2.2. Try to apply the principles you learned
    in chapter (1). 'Either...or' works kind of like 'If...then'. Commas
    indicate the bigger break. Aside from 'it is not the case that',
    negations negate the smallest sentence they are a part of.

    <div class="answers">

    $(U{\mathord{\wedge}}{\mathord{\sim}}R){\mathord{\vee}}({\mathord{\sim}}U{\mathord{\wedge}}R)$

    </div>

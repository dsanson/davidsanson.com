The following interactive supplements are designed to be used along with
David Kaplan’s [Logic 2010](http://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu/) and Terry
Parsons’ *An Exposition to Symbolic Logic* (i.e., the “Logic Text” that
is included with the Logic 2010 software).

This is a work in progress. Please let me know about any typos,
mistakes, or bugs.
